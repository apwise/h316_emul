Generic instructions for installing code can be found in INSTALL.

h16 provides some optional features:

The default is to compile with the GUI. However, if this is
not desired (or GTK is not available) then the emulator may be
compiled without the GUI as follows:

./configure --disable-gui

Even if the emulator is compiled with the GUI it may be used in
text mode by passing the -t as the first argument:

h16 -t

The emulator may be compiled with support for some experimental
devices associated with using the emulator as a reference model for
RTL verification (vsim and vdmc):

./configure --enable-verif

The emulator may be compiled with support for experimental SPI
storage devices (spi and fram):

./configure --enable-spi

To compile the verion of the ASR utility with adept support (to talk
to FPGA boards (such as the Digilent cmods6) configure with something
like this (depending on install locations):

./configure CFLAGS="-I /usr/include/digilent/adept" LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/digilent/adept

'help' may be typed at the "MON>" prompt:

In text mode (but not when using the GUI) a filename may be passed
which is used to supply commands to the monitor. This allows simple
batch processing scripts to be constructed:

h16 -t <script-file>
