</p><h1><a name="SEC1" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC1">1. Introduction</a></h1>

<p>
In the past, if a source code package developer wanted to take advantage
of the power of shared libraries, he needed to write custom support code
for each platform on which his package ran.  He also had to design a
configuration interface so that the package installer could choose what sort of
libraries were built.


</p><p>
GNU Libtool simplifies the developer's job by encapsulating both the
platform-specific dependencies, and the user interface, in a single
script.  GNU Libtool is designed so that the complete functionality of
each host type is available via a generic interface, but nasty quirks
are hidden from the programmer.


</p><p>
GNU Libtool's consistent interface is reassuring... users don't need
to read obscure documentation in order to have their favorite source
package build shared libraries.  They just run your package
<code>configure</code> script (or equivalent), and libtool does all the dirty
work.


</p><p>
There are several examples throughout this document.  All assume the
same environment: we want to build a library, <tt>`libhello'</tt>, in a
generic way.


</p><p>
<tt>`libhello'</tt> could be a shared library, a static library, or
both... whatever is available on the host system, as long as libtool
has been ported to it.


</p><p>
This chapter explains the original design philosophy of libtool.  Feel
free to skip to the next chapter, unless you are interested in history,
or want to write code to extend libtool in a consistent way.




</p><h2><a name="SEC2" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC2">1.1 Motivation for writing libtool</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX1"></a>
<a name="IDX2"></a>
Since early 1995, several different GNU developers have recognized the
importance of having shared library support for their packages.  The
primary motivation for such a change is to encourage modularity and
reuse of code (both conceptually and physically) in GNU programs.


</p><p>
Such a demand means that the way libraries are built in GNU packages
needs to be general, to allow for any library type the package installer
might want.  The problem is compounded by the absence of a standard
procedure for creating shared libraries on different platforms.


</p><p>
The following sections outline the major issues facing shared library
support in GNU, and how shared library support could be standardized
with libtool.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX3"></a>
<a name="IDX4"></a>
The following specifications were used in developing and evaluating this
system:



</p><ol>
<li>

The system must be as elegant as possible.

</li><li>

The system must be fully integrated with the GNU Autoconf and Automake
utilities, so that it will be easy for GNU maintainers to use.  However,
the system must not require these tools, so that it can be used by
non-GNU packages.

</li><li>

Portability to other (non-GNU) architectures and tools is desirable.
</li></ol>



<h2><a name="SEC3" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC3">1.2 Implementation issues</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX5"></a>
<a name="IDX6"></a>
The following issues need to be addressed in any reusable shared library
system, specifically libtool:



</p><ol>
<li>

The package installer should be able to control what sort of libraries
are built.

</li><li>

It can be tricky to run dynamically linked programs whose libraries have
not yet been installed.  <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> must be set properly (if
it is supported), or programs fail to run.

</li><li>

The system must operate consistently even on hosts which don't support
shared libraries.

</li><li>

The commands required to build shared libraries may differ wildly from
host to host.  These need to be determined at configure time in
a consistent way.

</li><li>

It is not always obvious with which suffix a shared library should be
installed.  This makes it difficult for <tt>`Makefile'</tt> rules, since they
generally assume that file names are the same from host to host.

</li><li>

The system needs a simple library version number abstraction, so that
shared libraries can be upgraded in place.  The programmer should be
informed how to design the interfaces to the library to maximize binary
compatibility.

</li><li>

The install <tt>`Makefile'</tt> target should warn the package installer to set
the proper environment variables (<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or equivalent),
or run <code>ldconfig</code>.
</li></ol>



<h2><a name="SEC4" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC4">1.3 Other implementations</a></h2>

<p>
Even before libtool was developed, many free software packages built and
installed their own shared libraries.  At first, these packages were
examined to avoid reinventing existing features.


</p><p>
Now it is clear that none of these packages have documented the details
of shared library systems that libtool requires.  So, other packages
have been more or less abandoned as influences.




</p><h2><a name="SEC5" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC5">1.4 A postmortem analysis of other implementations</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX7"></a>
<a name="IDX8"></a>
In all fairness, each of the implementations that were examined do the
job that they were intended to do, for a number of different host
systems.  However, none of these solutions seem to function well as a
generalized, reusable component.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX9"></a>
Most were too complex to use (much less modify) without understanding
exactly what the implementation does, and they were generally not
documented.


</p><p>
The main difficulty is that different vendors have different views of
what libraries are, and none of the packages which were examined seemed
to be confident enough to settle on a single paradigm that just
<em>works</em>.


</p><p>
Ideally, libtool would be a standard that would be implemented as series
of extensions and modifications to existing library systems to make them
work consistently.  However, it is not an easy task to convince
operating system developers to mend their evil ways, and people want to
build shared libraries right now, even on buggy, broken, confused
operating systems.


</p><p>
For this reason, libtool was designed as an independent shell script.
It isolates the problems and inconsistencies in library building that
plague <tt>`Makefile'</tt> writers by wrapping the compiler suite on
different platforms with a consistent, powerful interface.


</p><p>
With luck, libtool will be useful to and used by the GNU community, and
that the lessons that were learned in writing it will be taken up by
designers of future library systems.




</p><h1><a name="SEC6" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC6">2. The libtool paradigm</a></h1>

<p>
At first, libtool was designed to support an arbitrary number of library
object types.  After libtool was ported to more platforms, a new
paradigm gradually developed for describing the relationship between
libraries and programs.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX10"></a>
<a name="IDX11"></a>
In summary, "libraries are programs with multiple entry points, and
more formally defined interfaces."


</p><p>
Version 0.7 of libtool was a complete redesign and rewrite of libtool to
reflect this new paradigm.  So far, it has proved to be successful:
libtool is simpler and more useful than before.


</p><p>
The best way to introduce the libtool paradigm is to contrast it with
the paradigm of existing library systems, with examples from each.  It
is a new way of thinking, so it may take a little time to absorb, but
when you understand it, the world becomes simpler.




</p><h1><a name="SEC7" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC7">3. Using libtool</a></h1>

<p>
<a name="IDX12"></a>
<a name="IDX13"></a>
It makes little sense to talk about using libtool in your own packages
until you have seen how it makes your life simpler.  The examples in
this chapter introduce the main features of libtool by comparing the
standard library building procedure to libtool's operation on two
different platforms:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><samp>`a23'</samp>
</dt><dd>
An Ultrix 4.2 platform with only static libraries.

</dd><dt><samp>`burger'</samp>
</dt><dd>
A NetBSD/i386 1.2 platform with shared libraries.
</dd></dl>

<p>
You can follow these examples on your own platform, using the
preconfigured libtool script that was installed with libtool
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC26">5.3 Configuring libtool</a>).


</p><p>
Source files for the following examples are taken from the <tt>`demo'</tt>
subdirectory of the libtool distribution.  Assume that we are building a
library, <tt>`libhello'</tt>, out of the files <tt>`foo.c'</tt> and
<tt>`hello.c'</tt>.


</p><p>
Note that the <tt>`foo.c'</tt> source file uses the <code>cos</code> math library
function, which is usually found in the standalone math library, and not
the C library (see section `Trigonometric Functions' in <cite>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite>).  So, we need to add <kbd>-lm</kbd> to
the end of the link line whenever we link <tt>`foo.o'</tt> or <tt>`foo.lo'</tt>
into an executable or a library (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC39">8. Inter-library dependencies</a>).


</p><p>
The same rule applies whenever you use functions that don't appear in
the standard C library... you need to add the appropriate
<kbd>-l<var>name</var></kbd> flag to the end of the link line when you link
against those objects.


</p><p>
After we have built that library, we want to create a program by linking
<tt>`main.o'</tt> against <tt>`libhello'</tt>.




</p><h2><a name="SEC8" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC8">3.1 Creating object files</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX14"></a>
<a name="IDX15"></a>
To create an object file from a source file, the compiler is invoked
with the `-c' flag (and any other desired flags):



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gcc -g -O -c main.c</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
The above compiler command produces an object file, <tt>`main.o'</tt>, from
the source file <tt>`main.c'</tt>.


</p><p>
For most library systems, creating object files that become part of a
static library is as simple as creating object files that are linked to
form an executable:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gcc -g -O -c foo.c</kbd>
burger$ <kbd>gcc -g -O -c hello.c</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX16"></a>
<a name="IDX17"></a>
Shared libraries, however, may only be built from
<em>position-independent code</em> (PIC).  So, special flags must be passed
to the compiler to tell it to generate PIC rather than the standard
position-dependent code.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX18"></a>
<a name="IDX19"></a>
<a name="IDX20"></a>
Since this is a library implementation detail, libtool hides the
complexity of PIC compiler flags by using separate library object files
(which end in <samp>`.lo'</samp> instead of <samp>`.o'</samp>).  On systems without shared
libraries (or without special PIC compiler flags), these library object
files are identical to "standard" object files.


</p><p>
To create library object files for <tt>`foo.c'</tt> and <tt>`hello.c'</tt>,
simply invoke libtool with the standard compilation command as
arguments (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC16">4.1 Compile mode</a>):



</p><pre>a23$ <kbd>libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c foo.c</kbd>
gcc -g -O -c foo.c
echo timestamp &gt; foo.lo
a23$ <kbd>libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c hello.c</kbd>
gcc -g -O -c hello.c
echo timestamp &gt; hello.lo
a23$
</pre>

<p>
Note that libtool creates two files for each invocation.  The <samp>`.lo'</samp>
file is a library object, which may be built into a shared library, and
the <samp>`.o'</samp> file is a standard object file.  On <samp>`a23'</samp>, the
library objects are just timestamps, because only static libraries are
supported.


</p><p>
On shared library systems, libtool automatically inserts the PIC
generation flags into the compilation command, so that the library
object and the standard object differ:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c foo.c</kbd>
gcc -g -O -c -fPIC -DPIC foo.c
mv -f foo.o foo.lo
gcc -g -O -c foo.c &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c hello.c</kbd>
gcc -g -O -c -fPIC -DPIC hello.c
mv -f hello.o hello.lo
gcc -g -O -c hello.c &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the second run of GCC has its output discarded.  This is
done so that compiler warnings aren't annoyingly duplicated.

<p>
<a name="IDX21"></a>
Without libtool, the programmer would invoke the <code>ar</code> command to
create a static library:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>ar cru libhello.a hello.o foo.o</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX22"></a>
But of course, that would be too simple, so many systems require that
you run the <code>ranlib</code> command on the resulting library (to give it
better karma, or something):



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>ranlib libhello.a</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
It seems more natural to use the C compiler for this task, given
libtool's "libraries are programs" approach.  So, on platforms without
shared libraries, libtool simply acts as a wrapper for the system
<code>ar</code> (and possibly <code>ranlib</code>) commands.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX23"></a>
<a name="IDX24"></a>
Again, the libtool library name differs from the standard name (it has a
<samp>`.la'</samp> suffix instead of a <samp>`.a'</samp> suffix).  The arguments to libtool are
the same ones you would use to produce an executable named
<tt>`libhello.la'</tt> with your compiler (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>):



</p><pre>a23$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o libhello.la foo.o hello.o</kbd>
libtool: cannot build libtool library `libhello.la' from non-libtool \
                objects
a23$
</pre>

<p>
Aha!  Libtool caught a common error... trying to build a library
from standard objects instead of library objects.  This doesn't matter
for static libraries, but on shared library systems, it is of great
importance.


</p><p>
So, let's try again, this time with the library object files.  Remember
also that we need to add <kbd>-lm</kbd> to the link command line because
<tt>`foo.c'</tt> uses the <code>cos</code> math library function (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC7">3. Using libtool</a>).


</p><p>
Another complication in building shared libraries is that we need to
specify the path to the directory in which they (eventually) will be
installed (in this case, <tt>`/usr/local/lib'</tt>)<a name="DOCF1" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT1">(1)</a>:



</p><pre>a23$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o libhello.la foo.lo hello.lo \
                -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm</kbd>
mkdir .libs
ar cru .libs/libhello.a foo.o hello.o
ranlib .libs/libhello.a
creating libhello.la
a23$
</pre>

<p>
Now, let's try the same trick on the shared library platform:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o libhello.la foo.lo hello.lo \
                -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm</kbd>
mkdir .libs
ld -Bshareable -o .libs/libhello.so.0.0 foo.lo hello.lo -lm
ar cru .libs/libhello.a foo.o hello.o
ranlib .libs/libhello.a
creating libhello.la
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Now that's significantly cooler... libtool just ran an obscure
<code>ld</code> command to create a shared library, as well as the static
library.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX25"></a>
Note how libtool creates extra files in the <tt>`.libs'</tt>
subdirectory, rather than the current directory.  This feature is to
make it easier to clean up the build directory, and to help ensure that
other programs fail horribly if you accidentally forget to use libtool
when you should.




</p><h2><a name="SEC10" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC10">3.3 Linking executables</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX26"></a>
If you choose at this point to <em>install</em> the library (put it in a
permanent location) before linking executables against it, then you
don't need to use libtool to do the linking.  Simply use the appropriate
<samp>`-L'</samp> and <samp>`-l'</samp> flags to specify the library's location.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX27"></a>
Some system linkers insist on encoding the full directory name of each
shared library in the resulting executable.  Libtool has to work around
this misfeature by special magic to ensure that only permanent directory
names are put into installed executables.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX28"></a>
<a name="IDX29"></a>
The importance of this bug must not be overlooked: it won't cause
programs to crash in obvious ways.  It creates a security hole,
and possibly even worse, if you are modifying the library source code
after you have installed the package, you will change the behaviour of
the installed programs!


</p><p>
So, if you want to link programs against the library before you install
it, you must use libtool to do the linking.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX30"></a>
Here's the old way of linking against an uninstalled library:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gcc -g -O -o hell.old main.o libhello.a -lm</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Libtool's way is almost the same<a name="DOCF2" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT2">(2)</a>
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>):



</p><pre>a23$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o hell main.o libhello.la -lm</kbd>
gcc -g -O -o hell main.o ./.libs/libhello.a -lm
a23$
</pre>

<p>
That looks too simple to be true.  All libtool did was transform
<tt>`libhello.la'</tt> to <tt>`./.libs/libhello.a'</tt>, but remember
that <samp>`a23'</samp> has no shared libraries.


</p><p>
On <samp>`burger'</samp> the situation is different:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o hell main.o libhello.la -lm</kbd>
gcc -g -O -o .libs/hell main.o -L./.libs -R/usr/local/lib -lhello -lm
creating hell
burger$
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX31"></a>


</p><p>
Now assume <tt>`libhello.la'</tt> had already been installed, and you want
to link a new program with it.  You could figure out where it lives by
yourself, then run:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gcc -g -O -o test test.o -L/usr/local/lib -lhello</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
However, unless <tt>`/usr/local/lib'</tt> is in the standard library search
path, you won't be able to run <code>test</code>.  However, if you use libtool
to link the already-installed libtool library, it will do The Right
Thing (TM) for you:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o test test.o /usr/local/lib/libhello.la</kbd>
gcc -g -O -o .libs/test test.o -Wl,--rpath
-Wl,/usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/libhello.a -lm
creating test
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Note that libtool added the necessary run-time path flag, as well as
<samp>`-lm'</samp>, the library libhello.la depended upon.  Nice, huh?


</p><p>
Since libtool created a wrapper script, you should use libtool to
install it and debug it too.  However, since the program does not depend
on any uninstalled libtool library, it is probably usable even without
the wrapper script.  Libtool could probably be made smarter to avoid the
creation of the wrapper script in this case, but this is left as an
exercise for the reader.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX32"></a>
<a name="IDX33"></a>
Notice that the executable, <code>hell</code>, was actually created in the
<tt>`.libs'</tt> subdirectory.  Then, a wrapper script was created
in the current directory.


</p><p>
On NetBSD 1.2, libtool encodes the installation directory of
<tt>`libhello'</tt>, by using the <samp>`-R/usr/local/lib'</samp> compiler flag.
Then, the wrapper script guarantees that the executable finds the
correct shared library (the one in <tt>`./.libs'</tt>) until it is
properly installed.


</p><p>
Let's compare the two different programs:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>time ./hell.old</kbd>
Welcome to GNU Hell!
** This is not GNU Hello.  There is no built-in mail reader. **
        0.21 real         0.02 user         0.08 sys
burger$ <kbd>time ./hell</kbd>
Welcome to GNU Hell!
** This is not GNU Hello.  There is no built-in mail reader. **
        0.63 real         0.09 user         0.59 sys
burger$
</pre>

<p>
The wrapper script takes significantly longer to execute, but at least
the results are correct, even though the shared library hasn't been
installed yet.


</p><p>
So, what about all the space savings that shared libraries are supposed
to yield?



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>ls -l hell.old libhello.a</kbd>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 gord  gord  15481 Nov 14 12:11 hell.old
-rw-r--r--  1 gord  gord   4274 Nov 13 18:02 libhello.a
burger$ <kbd>ls -l .libs/hell .libs/libhello.*</kbd>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 gord  gord  11647 Nov 14 12:10 .libs/hell
-rw-r--r--  1 gord  gord   4274 Nov 13 18:44 .libs/libhello.a
-rwxr-xr-x  1 gord  gord  12205 Nov 13 18:44 .libs/libhello.so.0.0
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Well, that sucks.  Maybe I should just scrap this project and take up
basket weaving.


</p><p>
Actually, it just proves an important point: shared libraries incur
overhead because of their (relative) complexity.  In this situation, the
price of being dynamic is eight kilobytes, and the payoff is about four
kilobytes.  So, having a shared <tt>`libhello'</tt> won't be an advantage
until we link it against at least a few more programs.




</p><h2><a name="SEC11" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC11">3.4 Debugging executables</a></h2>

<p>
If <tt>`hell'</tt> was a complicated program, you would certainly want to
test and debug it before installing it on your system.  In the above
section, you saw how the libtool wrapper script makes it possible to run
the program directly, but unfortunately, this mechanism interferes with
the debugger:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gdb hell</kbd>

burger$
</pre>

<p>
Sad.  It doesn't work because GDB doesn't know where the executable
lives.  So, let's try again, by invoking GDB directly on the executable:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>gdb .libs/hell</kbd>

burger$
</pre>

<p>
Argh.  Now GDB complains because it cannot find the shared library that
<tt>`hell'</tt> is linked against.  So, we must use libtool in order to
properly set the library path and run the debugger.  Fortunately, we can
forget all about the <tt>`.libs'</tt> directory, and just run it on
the executable wrapper (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC18">4.3 Execute mode</a>):

<p>
<a name="IDX34"></a>
Installing libraries on a non-libtool system is quite
straightforward... just copy them into place:<a name="DOCF3" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT3">(3)</a>


</p><p>
<a name="IDX35"></a>

</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>su</kbd>

Oops, don't forget the <code>ranlib</code> command:



</p><pre>burger# <kbd>ranlib /usr/local/lib/libhello.a</kbd>
burger#
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX36"></a>
Libtool installation is quite simple, as well.  Just use the
<code>install</code> or <code>cp</code> command that you normally would
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC19">4.4 Install mode</a>):



</p><pre>a23# <kbd>libtool --mode=install cp libhello.la /usr/local/lib/libhello.la</kbd>

cp .libs/libhello.a /usr/local/lib/libhello.a
ranlib /usr/local/lib/libhello.a
a23#
</pre>

<p>
Note that the libtool library <tt>`libhello.la'</tt> is also installed, to
help libtool with uninstallation (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC21">4.6 Uninstall mode</a>) and linking
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC10">3.3 Linking executables</a>) and to help programs with dlopening
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC40">9. Dlopened modules</a>).


</p><p>
Here is the shared library example:



</p><pre>burger# <kbd>libtool --mode=install install -c libhello.la /usr/local/lib/libhello.la</kbd>
install -c .libs/libhello.so.0.0 /usr/local/lib/libhello.so.0.0
install -c libhello.la /usr/local/lib/libhello.la
install -c .libs/libhello.a /usr/local/lib/libhello.a
ranlib /usr/local/lib/libhello.a
burger#
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX37"></a>
<a name="IDX38"></a>
It is safe to specify the <samp>`-s'</samp> (strip symbols) flag if you use a
BSD-compatible install program when installing libraries.
Libtool will either ignore the <samp>`-s'</samp> flag, or will run a program
that will strip only debugging and compiler symbols from the library.


</p><p>
Once the libraries have been put in place, there may be some additional
configuration that you need to do before using them.  First, you must
make sure that where the library is installed actually agrees with the
<samp>`-rpath'</samp> flag you used to build it.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX39"></a>
<a name="IDX40"></a>
<a name="IDX41"></a>
Then, running <samp>`libtool -n --mode=finish <var>libdir</var>'</samp> can give you
further hints on what to do (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC20">4.5 Finish mode</a>):



</p><pre>burger# <kbd>libtool -n --mode=finish /usr/local/lib</kbd>
PATH="$PATH:/sbin" ldconfig -m /usr/local/lib
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

To link against installed libraries in a given directory, LIBDIR,
you must use the `-LLIBDIR' flag during linking.

 You will also need to do one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-RLIBDIR' linker flag

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld and ld.so manual pages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
burger#
</pre>

<p>
After you have completed these steps, you can go on to begin using the
installed libraries.  You may also install any executables that depend
on libraries you created.




</p><h2><a name="SEC13" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC13">3.6 Installing executables</a></h2>

<p>
If you used libtool to link any executables against uninstalled libtool
libraries (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC10">3.3 Linking executables</a>), you need to use libtool to
install the executables after the libraries have been installed
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC12">3.5 Installing libraries</a>).


</p><p>
So, for our Ultrix example, we would run:



</p><pre>a23# libtool install -c hell /usr/local/bin/hell
install -c hell /usr/local/bin/hell
a23#
</pre>

<p>
On shared library systems, libtool just ignores the wrapper script and
installs the correct binary:



</p><pre>burger# libtool install -c hell /usr/local/bin/hell
install -c .libs/hell /usr/local/bin/hell
burger#
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC14" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC14">3.7 Linking static libraries</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX42"></a>
<a name="IDX43"></a>
Why return to <code>ar</code> and <code>ranlib</code> silliness when you've had a
taste of libtool?  Well, sometimes it is desirable to create a static
archive that can never be shared.  The most frequent case is when you
have a set of object files that you use to build several different
programs.  You can create a "convenience library" out of those
objects, and link programs with the library, instead of listing all
object files for every program.  This technique is often used to
overcome GNU automake's lack of support for linking object files built
from sources in other directories, because it supports linking with
libraries from other directories.  This limitation applies to GNU
automake up to release 1.4; newer releases should support sources in
other directories.


</p><p>
If you just want to link this convenience library into programs, then
you could just ignore libtool entirely, and use the old <code>ar</code> and
<code>ranlib</code> commands (or the corresponding GNU automake
<samp>`_LIBRARIES'</samp> rules).  You can even install a convenience library
(but you probably don't want to) using libtool:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=install ./install-sh -c libhello.a /local/lib/libhello.a</kbd>
./install-sh -c libhello.a /local/lib/libhello.a
ranlib /local/lib/libhello.a
burger$
</pre>

<p>
Using libtool for static library installation protects your library from
being accidentally stripped (if the installer used the <samp>`-s'</samp> flag),
as well as automatically running the correct <code>ranlib</code> command.


</p><p>
But libtool libraries are more than just collections of object files:
they can also carry library dependency information, which old archives
do not.  If you want to create a libtool static convenience library, you
can omit the <samp>`-rpath'</samp> flag and use <samp>`-static'</samp> to indicate that
you're only interested in a static library.  When you link a program
with such a library, libtool will actually link all object files and
dependency libraries into the program.


</p><p>
If you omit both <samp>`-rpath'</samp> and <samp>`-static'</samp>, libtool will create a
convenience library that can be used to create other libtool
libraries, even shared ones.  Just like in the static case, the library
behaves as an alias to a set of object files and dependency libraries,
but in this case the object files are suitable for inclusion in shared
libraries.  But be careful not to link a single convenience library,
directly or indirectly, into a single program or library, otherwise you
may get errors about symbol redefinitions.


</p><p>
When GNU automake is used, you should use <code>noinst_LTLIBRARIES</code>
instead of <code>lib_LTLIBRARIES</code> for convenience libraries, so that
the <samp>`-rpath'</samp> option is not passed when they are linked.


</p><p>
As a rule of thumb, link a libtool convenience library into at most one
libtool library, and never into a program, and link libtool static
convenience libraries only into programs, and only if you need to carry
library dependency information to the user of the static convenience
library.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX44"></a>
Another common situation where static linking is desirable is in
creating a standalone binary.  Use libtool to do the linking and add the
<samp>`-all-static'</samp> flag.

Do not remove duplicate dependencies in libraries.  When building packages

situations, where -la -lb -la is required, and the second -la may not be
stripped or the link will fail.  In cases where these duplications are
required, this option will preserve them, only stripping the libraries
that libtool knows it can safely.

</dt><dd>
Use <var>mode</var> as the operation mode.  If not specified, an attempt is
made to inferr the operation mode from the <var>mode-args</var>.  Not specifying
the <var>mode</var> is currently deprecated, as there are too many situations
where it is not possible to guess.  Future versions of Libtool will require
that <var>mode</var> be explicity set.

<p>
The <var>mode-args</var> are a variable number of arguments, depending on the
selected operation mode.  In general, each <var>mode-arg</var> is interpreted
by programs libtool invokes, rather than libtool itself.




</p><h2><a name="SEC16" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC16">4.1 Compile mode</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX49"></a>
<a name="IDX50"></a>


</p><p>
For <em>compile</em> mode, <var>mode-args</var> is a compiler command to be used
in creating a `standard' object file.  These arguments should begin with
the name of the C compiler, and contain the <samp>`-c'</samp> compiler flag so
that only an object file is created.


</p><p>
Libtool determines the name of the output file by removing the directory
component from the source file name, then substituting the source code
suffix (e.g. <samp>`.c'</samp> for C source code) with the library object suffix,
<samp>`.lo'</samp>.


</p><p>
If shared libraries are being built, any necessary PIC generation flags
are substituted into the compilation command.  You can pass link specific
flags to the compiler driver using <samp>`-XCClinker <var>flag</var>'</samp> or pass
linker flags with <samp>`-Wl,<var>flag</var>'</samp> and <samp>`-Xlinker <var>flag</var>'</samp>.
You can also pass compile specific flags using <samp>`-Wc,<var>flag</var>'</samp>
and <samp>`-Xcompiler <var>flag</var>'</samp>.


</p><p>
If both PIC and non-PIC objects are being built, libtool will normally
supress the compiler output for the PIC object compilation to save
showing very similar, if not identical duplicate output for each
object.  If the <samp>`-no-suppress'</samp> option is given in compile mode,
libtool will show the compiler output for both objects.


</p><p>
If the <samp>`-static'</samp> option is given, then a <samp>`.o'</samp> file is built,
even if libtool was configured with <samp>`--disable-static'</samp>.


</p><p>
Note that the <samp>`-o'</samp> option is now fully supported.  It is emulated
on the platforms that don't support it (by locking and moving the
objects), so it is really easy to use libtool, just with minor
modifications to your Makefiles. Typing for example

</p><pre>libtool gcc -c foo/x.c -o foo/x.lo
</pre>

<p>
will do what you expect.


</p><p>
Note, however, that, if the compiler does not support <samp>`-c'</samp> and
<samp>`-o'</samp>, it is impossible to compile <tt>`foo/x.c'</tt> without
overwriting an existing <tt>`./x.o'</tt>.  Therefore, if you do have a
source file <tt>`./x.c'</tt>, make sure you introduce dependencies in your
<tt>`Makefile'</tt> to make sure <tt>`./x.o'</tt> (or <tt>`./x.lo'</tt>) is
re-created after any sub-directory's <tt>`x.lo'</tt>:

</p><pre>x.o x.lo: foo/x.lo bar/x.lo
</pre>

<p>
This will also ensure that make won't try to use a temporarily corrupted
<tt>`x.o'</tt> to create a program or library.  It may cause needless
recompilation on platforms that support <samp>`-c'</samp> and <samp>`-o'</samp>
together, but it's the only way to make it safe for those that don't.

<p>
<a name="IDX51"></a>
<a name="IDX52"></a>


</p><p>
<em>Link</em> mode links together object files (including library
objects) to form another library or to create an executable program.


</p><p>
<var>mode-args</var> consist of a command using the C compiler to create an
output file (with the <samp>`-o'</samp> flag) from several object files.


</p><p>
The following components of <var>mode-args</var> are treated specially:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><samp>`-all-static'</samp>
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX53"></a>
 <a name="IDX54"></a>
 
If <var>output-file</var> is a program, then do not link it against any
shared libraries at all.  If <var>output-file</var> is a library, then only
create a static library.

</dd><dt><samp>`-avoid-version'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Tries to avoid versioning (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC32">6. Library interface versions</a>) for libraries and modules,
i.e. no version information is stored and no symbolic links are created.
If the platform requires versioning, this option has no effect.

</dd><dt><samp>`-dlopen <var>file</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Same as <samp>`-dlpreopen <var>file</var>'</samp>, if native dlopening is not
supported on the host platform (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC40">9. Dlopened modules</a>) or if
the program is linked with <samp>`-static'</samp> or <samp>`-all-static'</samp>.
Otherwise, no effect.  If <var>file</var> is <code>self</code> libtool will make
sure that the program can <code>dlopen</code> itself, either by enabling
<code>-export-dynamic</code> or by falling back to <samp>`-dlpreopen self'</samp>.

</dd><dt><samp>`-dlpreopen <var>file</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Link <var>file</var> into the output program, and add its symbols to
<var>lt_preloaded_symbols</var> (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC42">9.2 Dlpreopening</a>).  If <var>file</var> is
<code>self</code>, the symbols of the program itself will be added to
<var>lt_preloaded_symbols</var>.
If <var>file</var> is <code>force</code> libtool will make sure that
<var>lt_preloaded_symbols</var> is always <em>defined</em>, regardless of whether
it's empty or not.

</dd><dt><samp>`-export-dynamic'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Allow symbols from <var>output-file</var> to be resolved with <code>dlsym</code>
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC40">9. Dlopened modules</a>).

</dd><dt><samp>`-export-symbols <var>symfile</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Tells the linker to export only the symbols listed in <var>symfile</var>.
The symbol file should end in <samp>`.sym'</samp> and must contain the name of one
symbol per line. This option has no effect on some platforms.
By default all symbols are exported.

</dd><dt><samp>`-export-symbols-regex <var>regex</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Same as <samp>`-export-symbols'</samp>, except that only symbols matching
the regular expression <var>regex</var> are exported.
By default all symbols are exported.

</dd><dt><samp>`-L<var>libdir</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Search <var>libdir</var> for required libraries that have already been
installed.

</dd><dt><samp>`-l<var>name</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
<var>output-file</var> requires the installed library <tt>`lib<var>name</var>'</tt>.
This option is required even when <var>output-file</var> is not an
executable.

</dd><dt><samp>`-module'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Creates a library that can be dlopened (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC40">9. Dlopened modules</a>).
This option doesn't work for programs.
Module names don't need to be prefixed with 'lib'.
In order to prevent name clashes, however, 'libname' and 'name'
must not be used at the same time in your package.

</dd><dt><samp>`-no-fast-install'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Disable fast-install mode for the executable <var>output-file</var>.  Useful
if the program won't be necessarily installed.

</dd><dt><samp>`-no-install'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Link an executable <var>output-file</var> that can't be installed and
therefore doesn't need a wrapper script.  Useful if the program is only
used in the build tree, e.g., for testing or generating other files.

</dd><dt><samp>`-no-undefined'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Declare that <var>output-file</var> does not depend on any other libraries.
Some platforms cannot create shared libraries that depend on other
libraries (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC39">8. Inter-library dependencies</a>).

</dd><dt><samp>`-o <var>output-file</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Create <var>output-file</var> from the specified objects and libraries.

</dd><dt><samp>`-precious-files-regex <var>regex</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Prevents removal of files from the temporary output directory whose
names match this regular expression.  You might specify <samp>`\.bbg?$'</samp>
to keep those files created with <code>gcc -ftest-coverage</code> for example.

</dd><dt><samp>`-release <var>release</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Specify that the library was generated by release <var>release</var> of your
package, so that users can easily tell which versions are newer than
others.  Be warned that no two releases of your package will be binary
compatible if you use this flag.  If you want binary compatibility, use
the <samp>`-version-info'</samp> flag instead (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC32">6. Library interface versions</a>).

</dd><dt><samp>`-rpath <var>libdir</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a library, it will eventually be installed in
<var>libdir</var>.  If <var>output-file</var> is a program, add <var>libdir</var> to
the run-time path of the program.

</dd><dt><samp>`-shrext <var>suffix</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a libtool library, replace the system's standard
file name extension for shared libraries with <var>suffix</var> (most systems
use <tt>`.so'</tt> here).  This option is helpful in certain cases where an
application requires that shared libraries (typically modules) have an
extension other than the default one.  Please note you must supply the
full file name extension including any leading dot.

</dd><dt><samp>`-R <var>libdir</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a program, add <var>libdir</var> to its run-time
path.  If <var>output-file</var> is a library, add -R<var>libdir</var> to its
<var>dependency_libs</var>, so that, whenever the library is linked into a
program, <var>libdir</var> will be added to its run-time path.

</dd><dt><samp>`-static'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a program, then do not link it against any
uninstalled shared libtool libraries.  If <var>output-file</var> is a
library, then only create a static library.

</dd><dt><samp>`-version-info <var>current</var>[:<var>revision</var>[:<var>age</var>]]'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a libtool library, use interface version
information <var>current</var>, <var>revision</var>, and <var>age</var> to build it
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC32">6. Library interface versions</a>).  Do <strong>not</strong> use this flag to specify package
release information, rather see the <samp>`-release'</samp> flag.

</dd><dt><samp>`-version-number <var>major</var>[:<var>minor</var>[:<var>revision</var>]]'</samp>
</dt><dd>
If <var>output-file</var> is a libtool library, compute interface version
information so that the resulting library uses the specified major, minor and
revision numbers.  This is designed to permit libtool to be used with
existing projects where identical version numbers are already used across
operating systems.  New projects should use the <samp>`-version-info'</samp> flag
instead.

</dd><dt><samp>`-Wl,<var>flag</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
</dd><dt><samp>`-Xlinker <var>flag</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Pass a linker specific flag directly to the linker.

</dd><dt><samp>`-XCClinker <var>flag</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Pass a link specific flag to the compiler driver (<var>CC</var>) during linking.
</dd></dl>

<p>
If the <var>output-file</var> ends in <samp>`.la'</samp>, then a libtool library is
created, which must be built only from library objects (<samp>`.lo'</samp> files).
The <samp>`-rpath'</samp> option is required.  In the current implementation,
libtool libraries may not depend on other uninstalled libtool libraries
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC39">8. Inter-library dependencies</a>).


</p><p>
If the <var>output-file</var> ends in <samp>`.a'</samp>, then a standard library is
created using <code>ar</code> and possibly <code>ranlib</code>.


</p><p>
<a name="IDX55"></a>
<a name="IDX56"></a>
If <var>output-file</var> ends in <samp>`.o'</samp> or <samp>`.lo'</samp>, then a reloadable object
file is created from the input files (generally using <samp>`ld -r'</samp>).
This method is often called <em>partial linking</em>.


</p><p>
Otherwise, an executable program is created.




</p><h2><a name="SEC18" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC18">4.3 Execute mode</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX57"></a>
<a name="IDX58"></a>


</p><p>
For <em>execute</em> mode, the library path is automatically set, then a
program is executed.


</p><p>
The first of the <var>mode-args</var> is treated as a program name, with the
rest as arguments to that program.


</p><p>
The following components of <var>mode-args</var> are treated specially:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><samp>`-dlopen <var>file</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
Add the directory containing <var>file</var> to the library path.
</dd></dl>

<p>
This mode sets the library path environment variable according to any
<samp>`-dlopen'</samp> flags.


</p><p>
If any of the <var>args</var> are libtool executable wrappers, then they are
translated into the name of their corresponding uninstalled binary, and
any of their required library directories are added to the library path.




</p><h2><a name="SEC19" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC19">4.4 Install mode</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX59"></a>
<a name="IDX60"></a>


</p><p>
In <em>install</em> mode, libtool interprets most of the elements of
<var>mode-args</var> as an installation command beginning with
<code>cp</code>, or a BSD-compatible <code>install</code> program.


</p><p>
The following components of <var>mode-args</var> are treated specially:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><samp>`-inst-prefix <var>inst-prefix-dir</var>'</samp>
</dt><dd>
When installing into a temporary staging area, rather than the
final <var>prefix</var>, this argument is used to reflect the
temporary path, in much the same way <code>automake</code> uses
<var>DESTDIR</var>.  For instance, if <var>prefix</var> is <code>/usr/local</code>,
but <var>inst-prefix-dir</var> is <code>/tmp</code>, then the object will be
installed under <code>/tmp/usr/local/</code>.  If the installed object
is a libtool library, then the internal fields of that library
will reflect only <var>prefix</var>, not <var>inst-prefix-dir</var>:


<pre># Directory that this library needs to be installed in:
libdir='/usr/local/lib'
</pre>

not


<pre># Directory that this library needs to be installed in:
libdir='/tmp/usr/local/lib'
</pre>

<code>inst-prefix</code> is also used to insure that if the installed
object must be relinked upon installation, that it is relinked
against the libraries in <var>inst-prefix-dir</var>/<var>prefix</var>,
not <var>prefix</var>.

In truth, this option is not really intended for use when calling
libtool directly; it is automatically used when <code>libtool --mode=install</code>
calls <code>libtool --mode=relink</code>.  Libtool does this by
analyzing the destination path given in the original
<code>libtool --mode=install</code> command and comparing it to the
expected installation path established during <code>libtool --mode=link</code>.

Thus, end-users need change nothing, and <code>automake</code>-style
<code>make install DESTDIR=/tmp</code> will Just Work(tm).
</dd></dl>

<p>
The rest of the <var>mode-args</var> are interpreted as arguments to the
<code>cp</code> or <code>install</code> command.


</p><p>
The command is run, and any necessary unprivileged post-installation
commands are also completed.

</p><p>
<em>Finish</em> mode helps system administrators install libtool libraries
so that they can be located and linked into user programs.


</p><p>
Each <var>mode-arg</var> is interpreted as the name of a library directory.
Running this command may require superuser privileges, so the

</p><h1><a name="SEC23" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC23">5. Integrating libtool with your package</a></h1>

<p>
This chapter describes how to integrate libtool with your packages so
that your users can install hassle-free shared libraries.




</p><h2><a name="SEC24" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC24">5.1 Writing <tt>`Makefile'</tt> rules for libtool</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX67"></a>
<a name="IDX68"></a>
<a name="IDX69"></a>


</p><p>
Libtool is fully integrated with Automake (see section `Introduction' in <cite>The Automake Manual</cite>), starting with Automake version 1.2.


</p><p>
If you want to use libtool in a regular <tt>`Makefile'</tt> (or
<tt>`Makefile.in'</tt>), you are on your own.  If you're not using Automake
1.2, and you don't know how to incorporate libtool into your package you
need to do one of the following:



</p><ol>
<li>

Download Automake (version 1.2 or later) from your nearest GNU mirror,
install it, and start using it.

</li><li>

Learn how to write <tt>`Makefile'</tt> rules by hand.  They're sometimes complex,
but if you're clever enough to write rules for compiling your old
libraries, then you should be able to figure out new rules for libtool
libraries (hint: examine the <tt>`Makefile.in'</tt> in the <tt>`demo'</tt>
subdirectory of the libtool distribution... note especially that it
was automatically generated from the <tt>`Makefile.am'</tt> by Automake).
</li></ol>



<h2><a name="SEC25" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC25">5.2 Using Automake with libtool</a></h2>

<p>
<a name="IDX70"></a>
Libtool library support is implemented under the <samp>`LTLIBRARIES'</samp>
primary.


</p><p>
Here are some samples from the Automake <tt>`Makefile.am'</tt> in the
libtool distribution's <tt>`demo'</tt> subdirectory.


</p><p>
First, to link a program against a libtool library, just use the
<samp>`program_LDADD'</samp> variable:



</p><pre>bin_PROGRAMS = hell hell.debug

# Build hell from main.c and libhello.la
hell_SOURCES = main.c
hell_LDADD = libhello.la

# Create an easier-to-debug version of hell.
hell_debug_SOURCES = main.c
hell_debug_LDADD = libhello.la
hell_debug_LDFLAGS = -static
</pre>

<p>
The flags <samp>`-dlopen'</samp> or <samp>`-dlpreopen'</samp> (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>) would
fit better in the <var>program_LDADD</var> variable.  Unfortunately, GNU
automake, up to release 1.4, doesn't accept these flags in a
<var>program_LDADD</var> variable, so you have the following alternatives:



</p><ul>
<li>

add them to <var>program_LDFLAGS</var>, and list the libraries in
<var>program_DEPENDENCIES</var>, then wait for a release of GNU automake that
accepts these flags where they belong;

</li><li>

surround the flags between quotes, but then you must set
<var>program_DEPENDENCIES</var> too:


<pre>program_LDADD = "-dlopen" libfoo.la
program_DEPENDENCIES = libfoo.la
</pre>

</li><li>

set and <samp>`AC_SUBST'</samp> variables <var>DLOPEN</var> and <var>DLPREOPEN</var> in
<tt>`configure.in'</tt> and use <samp>`@DLOPEN@'</samp> and <samp>`@DLPREOPEN@'</samp>
as replacements for the explicit flags <samp>`-dlopen'</samp> and
<samp>`-dlpreopen'</samp> in <samp>`program_LDADD'</samp>.  Automake will discard
<samp>`AC_SUBST'</samp>ed variables from dependencies, so it will behave exactly
as we expect it to behave when it accepts these flags in
<samp>`program_LDADD'</samp>.  But hey!, this is ugly!
</li></ul>

<p>
You may use the <samp>`program_LDFLAGS'</samp> variable to stuff in any flags
you want to pass to libtool while linking <samp>`program'</samp> (such as
<samp>`-static'</samp> to avoid linking uninstalled shared libtool libraries).


</p><p>
Building a libtool library is almost as trivial... note the use of
<samp>`libhello_la_LDFLAGS'</samp> to pass the <samp>`-version-info'</samp>
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC32">6. Library interface versions</a>) option to libtool:



</p><pre># Build a libtool library, libhello.la for installation in libdir.
lib_LTLIBRARIES = libhello.la
libhello_la_SOURCES = hello.c foo.c
libhello_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info 3:12:1
</pre>

<p>
The <samp>`-rpath'</samp> option is passed automatically by Automake (except for
libraries listed as <code>noinst_LTLIBRARIES</code>), so you
should not specify it.


</p><p>
See section `The Automake Manual' in <cite>The Automake Manual</cite>, for more information.




</p><h2><a name="SEC26" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC26">5.3 Configuring libtool</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX71"></a>


</p><p>
Libtool requires intimate knowledge of your compiler suite and operating
system in order to be able to create shared libraries and link against
them properly.  When you install the libtool distribution, a
system-specific libtool script is installed into your binary directory.


</p><p>
However, when you distribute libtool with your own packages
(see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC28">5.4 Including libtool in your package</a>), you do not always know which compiler suite and
operating system are used to compile your package.


</p><p>
For this reason, libtool must be <em>configured</em> before it can be
used.  This idea should be familiar to anybody who has used a GNU
<code>configure</code> script.  <code>configure</code> runs a number of tests for
system features, then generates the <tt>`Makefiles'</tt> (and possibly a
<tt>`config.h'</tt> header file), after which you can run <code>make</code> and
build the package.


</p><p>
Libtool adds its own tests to your <code>configure</code> script in order to
generate a libtool script for the installer's host machine.




</p><h3><a name="SEC27" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC27">5.3.1 The <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> macro</a></h3>

<p>
If you are using GNU Autoconf (or Automake), you should add a call to
<code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> to your <tt>`configure.in'</tt> file.  This macro
adds many new tests to the <code>configure</code> script so that the generated
libtool script will understand the characteristics of the host:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Macro:</u> <b>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX72"></a>
</dd><dt><u>Macro:</u> <b>AM_PROG_LIBTOOL</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX73"></a>
Add support for the <samp>`--enable-shared'</samp> and <samp>`--disable-shared'</samp>
<code>configure</code> flags.<a name="DOCF4" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT4">(4)</a>  <code>AM_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> was the
old name for this macro, and although supported at the moment is
deprecated.


<p>
By default, this macro turns on shared libraries if they are available,
and also enables static libraries if they don't conflict with the shared
libraries.  You can modify these defaults by calling either the
<code>AC_DISABLE_SHARED</code> or <code>AC_DISABLE_STATIC</code> macros:



</p><pre># Turn off shared libraries during beta-testing, since they
# make the build process take too long.
AC_DISABLE_SHARED
AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
</pre>

<p>
The user may specify modified forms of the configure flags
<samp>`--enable-shared'</samp> and <samp>`--enable-static'</samp> to choose whether
shared or static libraries are built based on the name of the package.
For example, to have shared <samp>`bfd'</samp> and <samp>`gdb'</samp> libraries built,
but not shared <samp>`libg++'</samp>, you can run all three <code>configure</code>
scripts as follows:



</p><pre>trick$ ./configure --enable-shared=bfd,gdb
</pre>

<p>
In general, specifying <samp>`--enable-shared=<var>pkgs</var>'</samp> is the same as
configuring with <samp>`--enable-shared'</samp> every package named in the
comma-separated <var>pkgs</var> list, and every other package with
<samp>`--disable-shared'</samp>.  The <samp>`--enable-static=<var>pkgs</var>'</samp> flag
behaves similarly, but it uses <samp>`--enable-static'</samp> and
<samp>`--disable-static'</samp>. The same applies to the
<samp>`--enable-fast-install=<var>pkgs</var>'</samp> flag, which uses
<samp>`--enable-fast-install'</samp> and <samp>`--disable-fast-install'</samp>.


</p><p>
The package name <samp>`default'</samp> matches any packages which have not set
their name in the <code>PACKAGE</code> environment variable.


</p><p>
This macro also sets the shell variable <var>LIBTOOL_DEPS</var>, that you can
use to automatically update the libtool script if it becomes
out-of-date.  In order to do that, add to your <tt>`configure.in'</tt>:



</p><pre>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
AC_SUBST(LIBTOOL_DEPS)
</pre>

<p>
and, to <tt>`Makefile.in'</tt> or <tt>`Makefile.am'</tt>:



</p><pre>LIBTOOL_DEPS = @LIBTOOL_DEPS@
libtool: $(LIBTOOL_DEPS)
        $(SHELL) ./config.status --recheck
</pre>

Enable checking for dlopen support. This macro should be used if
the package makes use of the <samp>`-dlopen'</samp> and <samp>`-dlpreopen'</samp> flags,

When you invoke the <code>libtoolize</code> program (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC29">5.4.1 Invoking <code>libtoolize</code></a>), it will tell you where to find a definition of
<code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code>.  If you use Automake, the <code>aclocal</code> program
will automatically add <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> support to your
<code>configure</code> script.


</p><p>
Nevertheless, it is advisable to include a copy of <tt>`libtool.m4'</tt> in
<tt>`acinclude.m4'</tt>, so that, even if <tt>`aclocal.m4'</tt> and
<tt>`configure'</tt> are rebuilt for any reason, the appropriate libtool
macros will be used.  The alternative is to hope the user will have a
compatible version of <tt>`libtool.m4'</tt> installed and accessible for
<code>aclocal</code>.  This may lead to weird errors when versions don't
match.




</p><h2><a name="SEC28" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC28">5.4 Including libtool in your package</a></h2>

<p>
In order to use libtool, you need to include the following files with
your package:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><tt>`config.guess'</tt>
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX94"></a>
Attempt to guess a canonical system name.

</dd></dl>

<p>
Note that the libtool script itself should <em>not</em> be included with
your package.  See section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC26">5.3 Configuring libtool</a>.


</p><p>
You should use the <code>libtoolize</code> program, rather than manually
copying these files into your package.

</p><p>
The <code>libtoolize</code> program provides a standard way to add libtool

</p><p>
The <code>libtoolize</code> program has the following synopsis:

<p>
and accepts the following options:

<p>
<a name="IDX101"></a>
If <code>libtoolize</code> detects an explicit call to
<code>AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR</code> (see section `The Autoconf Manual' in <cite>The Autoconf Manual</cite>) in your <tt>`configure.in'</tt>, it
will put the files in the specified directory.


</p><p>
<code>libtoolize</code> displays hints for adding libtool support to your
package, as well.




</p><h3><a name="SEC30" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC30">5.4.2 Autoconf <samp>`.o'</samp> macros</a></h3>

<p>
The Autoconf package comes with a few macros that run tests, then set a
variable corresponding to the name of an object file.  Sometimes it is
necessary to use corresponding names for libtool objects.


</p><p>
Here are the names of variables that list libtool objects:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Variable:</u> <b>LTALLOCA</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX102"></a>
<a name="IDX103"></a>
Substituted by <code>AC_FUNC_ALLOCA</code> (see section `The Autoconf Manual' in <cite>The Autoconf Manual</cite>).  Is either empty, or contains <samp>`alloca.lo'</samp>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Variable:</u> <b>LTLIBOBJS</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX104"></a>
<a name="IDX105"></a>
Substituted by <code>AC_REPLACE_FUNCS</code> (see section `The Autoconf Manual' in <cite>The Autoconf Manual</cite>), and a few other functions.
</dd></dl>


<p>
Unfortunately, the stable release of Autoconf (2.13, at the time of
this writing) does not have any way for libtool to provide support for
these variables.  So, if you depend on them, use the following code
immediately before the call to <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> in your
<tt>`configure.in'</tt>:



</p><pre>LTLIBOBJS=`echo "$LIBOBJS" | sed 's/\.[^.]* /.lo /g;s/\.[^.]*$/.lo/'`
AC_SUBST(LTLIBOBJS)
LTALLOCA=`echo "$ALLOCA" | sed 's/\.[^.]* /.lo /g;s/\.[^.]*$/.lo/'`
AC_SUBST(LTALLOCA)
AC_OUTPUT(...)

</p><p>
When you are developing a package, it is often worthwhile to configure
your package with the <samp>`--disable-shared'</samp> flag, or to override the
defaults for <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> by using the
<code>AC_DISABLE_SHARED</code> Autoconf macro (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC27">5.3.1 The <code>AC_PROG_LIBTOOL</code> macro</a>).  This prevents libtool from building
shared libraries, which has several advantages:



</p><ul>
<li>

compilation is twice as fast, which can speed up your development cycle,

</li><li>

debugging is easier because you don't need to deal with any complexities
added by shared libraries, and

</li><li>

you can see how libtool behaves on static-only platforms.
</li></ul>

<p>
You may want to put a small note in your package <tt>`README'</tt> to let
other developers know that <samp>`--disable-shared'</samp> can save them time.
The following example note is taken from the GIMP<a name="DOCF5" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT5">(5)</a> distribution <tt>`README'</tt>:



</p><pre>The GIMP uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
variety of systems. While this is very nice for making usable
binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that
reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
specifying the <samp>`--disable-shared'</samp> option to <tt>`configure'</tt>.

<h1><a name="SEC32" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC32">6. Library interface versions</a></h1>
<p>
<a name="IDX115"></a>
<a name="IDX116"></a>
<a name="IDX117"></a>


</p><p>
The most difficult issue introduced by shared libraries is that of
creating and resolving runtime dependencies.  Dependencies on programs
and libraries are often described in terms of a single name, such as
<code>sed</code>.  So, one may say "libtool depends on sed," and that is
good enough for most purposes.


</p><p>
However, when an interface changes regularly, we need to be more
specific: "Gnus 5.1 requires Emacs 19.28 or above."  Here, the
description of an interface consists of a name, and a "version
number."


</p><p>
Even that sort of description is not accurate enough for some purposes.
What if Emacs 20 changes enough to break Gnus 5.1?


</p><p>
The same problem exists in shared libraries: we require a formal version
system to describe the sorts of dependencies that programs have on
shared libraries, so that the dynamic linker can guarantee that programs
are linked only against libraries that provide the interface they
require.




</p><h2><a name="SEC33" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC33">6.1 What are library interfaces?</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX118"></a>


</p><p>
Interfaces for libraries may be any of the following (and more):



</p><ul>
<li>

global variables: both names and types

</li><li>

global functions: argument types and number, return types, and function names

</li><li>

standard input, standard output, standard error, and file formats

</li><li>

sockets, pipes, and other inter-process communication protocol formats
</li></ul>

<p>
Note that static functions do not count as interfaces, because they are
not directly available to the user of the library.




</p><h2><a name="SEC34" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC34">6.2 Libtool's versioning system</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX119"></a>
<a name="IDX120"></a>
<a name="IDX121"></a>


</p><p>
Libtool has its own formal versioning system.  It is not as flexible as
some, but it is definitely the simplest of the more powerful versioning
systems.


</p><p>
Think of a library as exporting several sets of interfaces, arbitrarily
represented by integers.  When a program is linked against a library, it
may use any subset of those interfaces.


</p><p>
Libtool's description of the interfaces that a program uses is simple:
it encodes the least and the greatest interface numbers in the resulting
binary (<var>first-interface</var>, <var>last-interface</var>).


</p><p>
The dynamic linker is guaranteed that if a library supports <em>every</em>
interface number between <var>first-interface</var> and <var>last-interface</var>,
then the program can be relinked against that library.


</p><p>
Note that this can cause problems because libtool's compatibility
requirements are actually stricter than is necessary.


</p><p>
Say <tt>`libhello'</tt> supports interfaces 5, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and that
libtool is used to link <tt>`test'</tt> against <tt>`libhello'</tt>.


</p><p>
Libtool encodes the numbers 5 and 19 in <tt>`test'</tt>, and the dynamic
linker will only link <tt>`test'</tt> against libraries that support
<em>every</em> interface between 5 and 19.  So, the dynamic linker refuses
to link <tt>`test'</tt> against <tt>`libhello'</tt>!


</p><p>
In order to eliminate this problem, libtool only allows libraries to
declare consecutive interface numbers.  So, <tt>`libhello'</tt> can declare at
most that it supports interfaces 16 through 19.  Then, the dynamic
linker will link <tt>`test'</tt> against <tt>`libhello'</tt>.


</p><p>
So, libtool library versions are described by three integers:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt><var>current</var>
</dt><dd>
The most recent interface number that this library implements.

</dd><dt><var>revision</var>
</dt><dd>
The implementation number of the <var>current</var> interface.

</dd><dt><var>age</var>
</dt><dd>
The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this
library implements.  In other words, the library implements all the
interface numbers in the range from number <code><var>current</var> -
<var>age</var></code> to <code><var>current</var></code>.
</dd></dl>

<p>
If two libraries have identical <var>current</var> and <var>age</var> numbers,
then the dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater
<var>revision</var> number.




</p><h2><a name="SEC35" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC35">6.3 Updating library version information</a></h2>

<p>
If you want to use libtool's versioning system, then you must specify
the version information to libtool using the <samp>`-version-info'</samp> flag
during link mode (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>).


</p><p>
This flag accepts an argument of the form
<samp>`<var>current</var>[:<var>revision</var>[:<var>age</var>]]'</samp>.  So, passing
<samp>`-version-info 3:12:1'</samp> sets <var>current</var> to 3, <var>revision</var> to
12, and <var>age</var> to 1.


</p><p>
If either <var>revision</var> or <var>age</var> are omitted, they default to 0.
Also note that <var>age</var> must be less than or equal to the <var>current</var>
interface number.


</p><p>
Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version
information:



</p><ol>
<li>

Start with version information of <samp>`0:0:0'</samp> for each libtool library.

</li><li>

Update the version information only immediately before a public release
of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only
guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.

</li><li>

If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
then increment <var>revision</var> (<samp>`<var>c</var>:<var>r</var>:<var>a</var>'</samp> becomes
<samp>`<var>c</var>:<em>r+1</em>:<var>a</var>'</samp>).

</li><li>

If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
update, increment <var>current</var>, and set <var>revision</var> to 0.

</li><li>

If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
increment <var>age</var>.

</li><li>

If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
set <var>age</var> to 0.
</li></ol>

<p>
<strong><em>Never</em></strong> try to set the interface numbers so that they
correspond to the release number of your package.  This is an abuse that
only fosters misunderstanding of the purpose of library versions.
Instead, use the <samp>`-release'</samp> flag (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC36">6.4 Managing release information</a>), but be
warned that every release of your package will not be binary compatible
with any other release.




</p><h2><a name="SEC36" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC36">6.4 Managing release information</a></h2>

<p>
Often, people want to encode the name of the package release into the
shared library so that it is obvious to the user which package their
programs are linked against.  This convention is used especially on
GNU/Linux:



</p><pre>trick$ <kbd>ls /usr/lib/libbfd*</kbd>
/usr/lib/libbfd.a	    /usr/lib/libbfd.so.2.7.0.2
/usr/lib/libbfd.so
trick$
</pre>

<p>
On <samp>`trick'</samp>, <tt>`/usr/lib/libbfd.so'</tt> is a symbolic link to
<tt>`libbfd.so.2.7.0.2'</tt>, which was distributed as a part of
<samp>`binutils-2.7.0.2'</samp>.


</p><p>
Unfortunately, this convention conflicts directly with libtool's idea of
library interface versions, because the library interface rarely changes
at the same time that the release number does, and the library suffix is
never the same across all platforms.


</p><p>
So, in order to accommodate both views, you can use the <samp>`-release'</samp>
flag in order to set release information for libraries which you do not
want to use <samp>`-version-info'</samp>.  For the <tt>`libbfd'</tt> example, the
next release which uses libtool should be built with <samp>`-release
2.9.0'</samp>, which will produce the following files on GNU/Linux:



</p><pre>trick$ <kbd>ls /usr/lib/libbfd*</kbd>
/usr/lib/libbfd-2.9.0.so     /usr/lib/libbfd.a
/usr/lib/libbfd.so
trick$
</pre>

<p>
In this case, <tt>`/usr/lib/libbfd.so'</tt> is a symbolic link to
<tt>`libbfd-2.9.0.so'</tt>.  This makes it obvious that the user is dealing
with <samp>`binutils-2.9.0'</samp>, without compromising libtool's idea of
interface versions.


</p><p>
Note that this option causes a modification of the library name, so do
not use it unless you want to break binary compatibility with any past
library releases.  In general, you should only use <samp>`-release'</samp> for
package-internal libraries or for ones whose interfaces change very
frequently.




</p><h1><a name="SEC37" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC37">7. Tips for interface design</a></h1>
<p>
<a name="IDX122"></a>
<a name="IDX123"></a>


</p><p>
Writing a good library interface takes a lot of practice and thorough
understanding of the problem that the library is intended to solve.


</p><p>
If you design a good interface, it won't have to change often, you won't
have to keep updating documentation, and users won't have to keep
relearning how to use the library.


</p><p>
Here is a brief list of tips for library interface design, which may
help you in your exploits:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt>Plan ahead
</dt><dd>
Try to make every interface truly minimal, so that you won't need to
delete entry points very often.

</dd><dt>Avoid interface changes
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX124"></a>
Some people love redesigning and changing entry points just for the heck
of it (note: <em>renaming</em> a function is considered changing an entry
point).  Don't be one of those people.  If you must redesign an
interface, then try to leave compatibility functions behind so that
users don't need to rewrite their existing code.

</dd><dt>Use opaque data types
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX125"></a>
The fewer data type definitions a library user has access to, the
better.  If possible, design your functions to accept a generic pointer
(which you can cast to an internal data type), and provide access
functions rather than allowing the library user to directly manipulate
the data.
That way, you have the freedom to change the data structures without
changing the interface.

This is essentially the same thing as using abstract data types and
inheritance in an object-oriented system.

</dd><dt>Use header files
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX126"></a>
If you are careful to document each of your library's global functions
and variables in header files, and include them in your library source
files, then the compiler will let you know if you make any interface
changes by accident (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC38">7.1 Writing C header files</a>).

</dd><dt>Use the <code>static</code> keyword (or equivalent) whenever possible
</dt><dd>
<a name="IDX127"></a>
The fewer global functions your library has, the more flexibility you'll
have in changing them.  Static functions and variables may change forms
as often as you like... your users cannot access them, so they
aren't interface changes.

</dd><dt>Be careful with array dimensions
</dt><dd>
The number of elements in a global array is part of an interface, even
if the header just declares <code>extern int foo[];</code>.  This is because
on i386 and some other SVR4/ELF systems, when an application
references data in a shared library the size of that data (whatever
its type) is included in the application executable.  If you might
want to change the size of an array or string then provide a pointer
not the actual array.

</p><p>
Writing portable C header files can be difficult, since they may be read
by different types of compilers:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt>C++ compilers
</dt><dd>
C++ compilers require that functions be declared with full prototypes,
since C++ is more strongly typed than C.  C functions and variables also
need to be declared with the <code>extern "C"</code> directive, so that the
names aren't mangled.  See section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC54">11.1 Writing libraries for C++</a>, for other issues relevant
to using C++ with libtool.

</dd><dt>ANSI C compilers
</dt><dd>
ANSI C compilers are not as strict as C++ compilers, but functions
should be prototyped to avoid unnecessary warnings when the header file
is <code>#include</code>d.

</dd><dt>non-ANSI C compilers
</dt><dd>
Non-ANSI compilers will report errors if functions are prototyped.
</dd></dl>

<p>
These complications mean that your library interface headers must use
some C preprocessor magic in order to be usable by each of the above
compilers.


</p><p>
<tt>`foo.h'</tt> in the <tt>`demo'</tt> subdirectory of the libtool distribution
serves as an example for how to write a header file that can be
safely installed in a system directory.


</p><p>
Here are the relevant portions of that file:



</p><pre>/* BEGIN_C_DECLS should be used at the beginning of your declarations,
   so that C++ compilers don't mangle their names.  Use END_C_DECLS at
   the end of C declarations. */
#undef BEGIN_C_DECLS
#undef END_C_DECLS
#ifdef __cplusplus
# define BEGIN_C_DECLS extern "C" {
# define END_C_DECLS }
#else
# define BEGIN_C_DECLS /* empty */
# define END_C_DECLS /* empty */
#endif

/* PARAMS is a macro used to wrap function prototypes, so that
   compilers that don't understand ANSI C prototypes still work,
   and ANSI C compilers can issue warnings about type mismatches. */
#undef PARAMS
#if defined (__STDC__) || defined (_AIX) \
        || (defined (__mips) &amp;&amp; defined (_SYSTYPE_SVR4)) \
        || defined(WIN32) || defined(__cplusplus)
# define PARAMS(protos) protos
#else
# define PARAMS(protos) ()
#endif
</pre>

<p>
These macros are used in <tt>`foo.h'</tt> as follows:



</p><pre>#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H 1

/* The above macro definitions. */
#include "..."

BEGIN_C_DECLS

int foo PARAMS((void));
int hello PARAMS((void));

END_C_DECLS

#endif /* !FOO_H */
</pre>

<p>
Note that the <tt>`#ifndef FOO_H'</tt> prevents the body of <tt>`foo.h'</tt>
from being read more than once in a given compilation.


</p><p>
Also the only thing that must go outside the
<code>BEGIN_C_DECLS</code>/<code>END_C_DECLS</code> pair are <code>#include</code> lines.
Strictly speaking it is only C symbol names that need to be protected,
but your header files will be more maintainable if you have a single
pair of of these macros around the majority of the header contents.


</p><p>
You should use these definitions of <code>PARAMS</code>, <code>BEGIN_C_DECLS</code>,
and <code>END_C_DECLS</code> into your own headers.  Then, you may use them to
create header files that are valid for C++, ANSI, and non-ANSI
compilers<a name="DOCF6" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT6">(6)</a>.


</p><p>
Do not be naive about writing portable code.  Following the tips given
above will help you miss the most obvious problems, but there are
definitely other subtle portability issues.  You may need to cope with
some of the following issues:



</p><ul>
<li>

Pre-ANSI compilers do not always support the <code>void *</code> generic
pointer type, and so need to use <code>char *</code> in its place.

</li><li>

The <code>const</code>, <code>inline</code> and <code>signed</code> keywords are not
supported by some compilers, especially pre-ANSI compilers.

</li><li>

The <code>long double</code> type is not supported by many compilers.

<h1><a name="SEC39" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC39">8. Inter-library dependencies</a></h1>
<p>
<a name="IDX131"></a>
<a name="IDX132"></a>


</p><p>
By definition, every shared library system provides a way for
executables to depend on libraries, so that symbol resolution is
deferred until runtime.


</p><p>
An <em>inter-library dependency</em> is one in which a library depends on
other libraries.  For example, if the libtool library <tt>`libhello'</tt>
uses the <code>cos</code> function, then it has an inter-library dependency
on <tt>`libm'</tt>, the math library that implements <code>cos</code>.


</p><p>
Some shared library systems provide this feature in an
internally-consistent way: these systems allow chains of dependencies of
potentially infinite length.


</p><p>
However, most shared library systems are restricted in that they only
allow a single level of dependencies.  In these systems, programs may
depend on shared libraries, but shared libraries may not depend on other
shared libraries.


</p><p>
In any event, libtool provides a simple mechanism for you to declare
inter-library dependencies: for every library <tt>`lib<var>name</var>'</tt> that
your own library depends on, simply add a corresponding
<code>-l<var>name</var></code> option to the link line when you create your
library.  To make an example of our
<tt>`libhello'</tt> that depends on <tt>`libm'</tt>:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -g -O -o libhello.la foo.lo hello.lo \
                -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
When you link a program against <tt>`libhello'</tt>, you don't need to
specify the same <samp>`-l'</samp> options again: libtool will do that for you,
in order to guarantee that all the required libraries are found.  This
restriction is only necessary to preserve compatibility with static
library systems and simple dynamic library systems.


</p><p>
Some platforms, such as AIX, do not even allow you this
flexibility.  In order to build a shared library, it must be entirely
self-contained (that is, have references only to symbols that are found
in the <samp>`.lo'</samp> files or the specified <samp>`-l'</samp> libraries), and you
need to specify the <var>-no-undefined</var> flag.  By default, libtool
builds only static libraries on these kinds of platforms.


</p><p>
The simple-minded inter-library dependency tracking code of libtool
releases prior to 1.2 was disabled because it was not clear when it was
possible to link one library with another, and complex failures would
occur.  A more complex implementation of this concept was re-introduced
before release 1.3, but it has not been ported to all platforms that
libtool supports.  The default, conservative behavior is to avoid
linking one library with another, introducing their inter-dependencies
only when a program is linked with them.

<a name="IDX140"></a>


</p><p>
It can sometimes be confusing to discuss <em>dynamic linking</em>, because
the term is used to refer to two different concepts:



</p><ol>
<li>

Compiling and linking a program against a shared library, which is
resolved automatically at run time by the dynamic linker.  In this
process, dynamic linking is transparent to the application.

</li><li>

The application calling functions such as <code>dlopen</code>,<a name="DOCF7" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT7">(7)</a> which load
arbitrary, user-specified modules at runtime.  This type of dynamic
linking is explicitly controlled by the application.
</li></ol>

<p>
To mitigate confusion, this manual refers to the second type of dynamic
linking as <em>dlopening</em> a module.


</p><p>
The main benefit to dlopening object modules is the ability to access
compiled object code to extend your program, rather than using an
interpreted language.  In fact, dlopen calls are frequently used in
language interpreters to provide an efficient way to extend the
language.


</p><p>
As of version 1.5.10, libtool provides support for dlopened
modules.  However, you should indicate that your package is willing to
use such support, by using the macro <samp>`AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN'</samp> in
<tt>`configure.in'</tt>.  If this macro is not used (or it is used
<em>after</em> <samp>`AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'</samp>), libtool will assume no dlopening
mechanism is available, and will try to simulate it.


</p><p>
This chapter discusses how you as a dlopen application developer might
use libtool to generate dlopen-accessible modules.




</p><h2><a name="SEC41" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC41">9.1 Building modules to dlopen</a></h2>

<p>
On some operating systems, a program symbol must be specially declared
in order to be dynamically resolved with the <code>dlsym</code> (or
equivalent) function.


</p><p>
Libtool provides the <samp>`-export-dynamic'</samp> and <samp>`-module'</samp>
link flags (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>), which do this declaration.
You need to use these flags if you are linking an application program that
dlopens other modules or a libtool library that will also be dlopened.


</p><p>
For example, if we wanted to build a shared library, <tt>`libhello'</tt>,
that would later be dlopened by an application, we would add
<samp>`-module'</samp> to the other link flags:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -module -o libhello.la foo.lo \
                hello.lo -rpath /usr/local/lib -lm</kbd>
burger$
</pre>

<p>
If symbols from your <em>executable</em> are needed to satisfy unresolved
references in a library you want to dlopen you will have to use the flag
<samp>`-export-dynamic'</samp>.
You should use <samp>`-export-dynamic'</samp> while linking the executable that calls
dlopen:



</p><pre>burger$ <kbd>libtool --mode=link gcc -export-dynamic -o hell-dlopener main.o</kbd>
burger$
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC42" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC42">9.2 Dlpreopening</a></h2>

<p>
Libtool provides special support for dlopening libtool object and
libtool library files, so that their symbols can be resolved <em>even
on platforms without any <code>dlopen</code> and <code>dlsym</code>
functions</em>.


</p><p>
Consider the following alternative ways of loading code into your
program, in order of increasing "laziness":



</p><ol>
<li>

Linking against object files that become part of the program executable,
whether or not they are referenced.  If an object file cannot be found,
then the linker refuses to create the executable.

</li><li>

Declaring a static library to the linker, so that it is searched at link
time in order to satisfy any undefined references in the above object
files.  If the static library cannot be found, then the linker refuses
to link the executable.

</li><li>

Declaring a shared library to the runtime linker, so that it is searched
at runtime in order to satisfy any undefined references in the above
files.  If the shared library cannot be found, then the dynamic linker
aborts the program before it runs.

</li><li>

Dlopening a module, so that the application can resolve its own,
dynamically-computed references.  If there is an error opening the
module, or the module is not found, then the application can recover
without crashing.
</li></ol>

<p>
Libtool emulates <samp>`-dlopen'</samp> on static platforms by linking objects
into the program at compile time, and creating data structures that
represent the program's symbol table.


</p><p>
In order to use this feature, you must declare the objects you want your
application to dlopen by using the <samp>`-dlopen'</samp> or <samp>`-dlpreopen'</samp>
flags when you link your program (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC17">4.2 Link mode</a>).


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Structure:</u> struct <b>lt_dlsymlist</b> <i>{ const char *<var>name</var>; lt_ptr <var>address</var>; }</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX141"></a>
The <var>name</var> attribute is a null-terminated character string of the
symbol name, such as <code>"fprintf"</code>.  The <var>address</var> attribute is a
generic pointer to the appropriate object, such as <code>&amp;fprintf</code>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Variable:</u> const lt_dlsymlist * <b>lt_preloaded_symbols</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX142"></a>
An array of <var>lt_symbol</var> structures, representing all the preloaded
symbols linked into the program. For each <samp>`-dlpreloaded'</samp> file
there is an element with the <var>name</var> of the file and a <var>address</var>
of <code>0</code>, followed by all symbols exported from this file.
For the executable itself the special name @PROGRAM@ is used.
The last element has a <var>name</var> and <var>address</var> of <code>0</code>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
Some compilers may allow identifiers which are not valid in ANSI C, such
as dollar signs.  Libtool only recognizes valid ANSI C symbols (an
initial ASCII letter or underscore, followed by zero or more ASCII
letters, digits, and underscores), so non-ANSI symbols will not appear
in <var>lt_preloaded_symbols</var>.




</p><h2><a name="SEC43" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC43">9.3 Finding the correct name to dlopen</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="IDX143"></a>
<a name="IDX144"></a>


</p><p>
After a library has been linked with <samp>`-module'</samp>, it can be dlopened.
Unfortunately, because of the variation in library names,
your package needs to determine the correct file to dlopen.


</p><p>
The most straightforward and flexible implementation is to determine the
name at runtime, by finding the installed <samp>`.la'</samp> file, and searching
it for the following lines:



</p><pre># The name that we can <code>dlopen</code>.
dlname='<var>dlname</var>'
</pre>

<p>
If <var>dlname</var> is empty, then the library cannot be dlopened.
Otherwise, it gives the dlname of the library.  So, if the library was
installed as <tt>`/usr/local/lib/libhello.la'</tt>, and the <var>dlname</var> was
<tt>`libhello.so.3'</tt>, then <tt>`/usr/local/lib/libhello.so.3'</tt> should be
dlopened.


</p><p>
If your program uses this approach, then it should search the
directories listed in the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code><a name="DOCF8" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#FOOT8">(8)</a> environment variable, as well as
the directory where libraries will eventually be installed.  Searching
this variable (or equivalent) will guarantee that your program can find
its dlopened modules, even before installation, provided you have linked
them using libtool.

<a name="IDX147"></a>


</p><p>
The following problems are not solved by using libtool's dlopen support:



</p><ul>
<li>

Dlopen functions are generally only available on shared library
platforms.  If you want your package to be portable to static platforms,
you have to use either libltdl (see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC45">10. Using libltdl</a>) or develop your
own alternatives to dlopening dynamic code.
Most reasonable solutions involve writing wrapper functions for the
<code>dlopen</code> family, which do package-specific tricks when dlopening
is unsupported or not available on a given platform.

</li><li>

There are major differences in implementations of the <code>dlopen</code>
family of functions.  Some platforms do not even use the same function
names (notably HP-UX, with its <code>shl_load</code> family).

</li><li>

The application developer must write a custom search function in order
to discover the correct module filename to supply to <code>dlopen</code>.

</p><p>
Libtool provides a small library, called <tt>`libltdl'</tt>, that aims at
hiding the various difficulties of dlopening libraries from programmers.
It consists of a header-file and a small C source file that can be
distributed with applications that need dlopening functionality.  On
some platforms, whose dynamic linkers are too limited for a simple
implementation of <tt>`libltdl'</tt> services, it requires GNU DLD, or it
will only emulate dynamic linking with libtool's dlpreopening mechanism.


</p><p>
libltdl supports currently the following dynamic linking mechanisms:



</p><ul>
<li>

<code>dlopen</code> (Solaris, Linux and various BSD flavors)
</li><li>

<code>shl_load</code> (HP-UX)
</li><li>

<code>LoadLibrary</code> (Win16 and Win32)
</li><li>

<code>load_add_on</code> (BeOS)
</li><li>

GNU DLD (emulates dynamic linking for static libraries)
</li><li>

libtool's dlpreopen (see see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC42">9.2 Dlpreopening</a>)
</li></ul>

<p>
libltdl is licensed under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License,
with the following exception:



</p><blockquote>
<p>
As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License,
if you distribute this file as part of a program or library that
is built using GNU libtool, you may include it under the same

</p></blockquote>



<h2><a name="SEC46" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC46">10.1 How to use libltdl in your programs</a></h2>

<p>
The libltdl API is similar to the dlopen interface of Solaris and Linux,
which is very simple but powerful.


</p><p>
To use libltdl in your program you have to include the header file <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt>:



</p><pre>#include &lt;ltdl.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The last release of libltdl used some symbols that violated the
POSIX namespace conventions.  These symbols are now deprecated,
and have been replaced by those described here.  If you have code that
relies on the old deprecated symbol names, defining
<samp>`LT_NON_POSIX_NAMESPACE'</samp> before you include <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt> provides
conversion macros.  Whichever set of symbols you use, the new api is
not binary compatible with the last, so you will need to recompile
your application in order to use this version of libltdl.


</p><p>
Note that libltdl is not threadsafe, i.e. a multithreaded application
has to use a mutex for libltdl.  It was reported that GNU/Linux's glibc
2.0's <code>dlopen</code> with <samp>`RTLD_LAZY'</samp> (which libltdl uses by
default) is not thread-safe, but this problem is supposed to be fixed in
glibc 2.1.  On the other hand, <samp>`RTLD_NOW'</samp> was reported to introduce
problems in multi-threaded applications on FreeBSD.  Working around
these problems is left as an exercise for the reader; contributions are
certainly welcome.


</p><p>
The following types are defined in <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt>:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_ptr</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX158"></a>
<code>lt_ptr</code> is a generic pointer.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_dlhandle</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX159"></a>
<code>lt_dlhandle</code> is a module "handle".
Every lt_dlopened module has a handle associated with it.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_dlsymlist</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX160"></a>
<code>lt_dlsymlist</code> is a symbol list for dlpreopened modules.
This structure is described in see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC42">9.2 Dlpreopening</a>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
libltdl provides the following functions:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlinit</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX161"></a>
Initialize libltdl.
This function must be called before using libltdl
and may be called several times.
Return 0 on success, otherwise the number of errors.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlexit</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX162"></a>
Shut down libltdl and close all modules.
This function will only then shut down libltdl when it was called as
many times as <code>lt_dlinit</code> has been successfully called.
Return 0 on success, otherwise the number of errors.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_dlhandle <b>lt_dlopen</b> <i>(const char *<var>filename</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX163"></a>
Open the module with the file name <var>filename</var> and return a
handle for it.  <code>lt_dlopen</code> is able to open libtool dynamic
modules, preloaded static modules, the program itself and
native dynamic libraries.


<p>
Unresolved symbols in the module are resolved using its dependency
libraries (not implemented yet) and previously dlopened modules.  If the
executable using this module was linked with the <code>-export-dynamic</code>
flag, then the global symbols in the executable will also be used to
resolve references in the module.


</p><p>
If <var>filename</var> is <code>NULL</code> and the program was linked with
<code>-export-dynamic</code> or <code>-dlopen self</code>, <code>lt_dlopen</code> will
return a handle for the program itself, which can be used to access its
symbols.


</p><p>
If libltdl cannot find the library and the file name <var>filename</var> does
not have a directory component it will additionally search in the
following search paths for the module (in the order as follows):



</p><ol>
<li>user-defined search path:

This search path can be changed by the program using the
functions <code>lt_dlsetsearchpath</code>, <code>lt_dladdsearchdir</code> and
<code>lt_dlinsertsearchdir</code>.

</li><li>libltdl's search path:

This search path is the value of the environment variable
<var>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</var>.

</li><li>system library search path:

The system dependent library search path
(e.g. on Linux it is <var>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</var>).
</li></ol>

<p>
Each search path must be a colon-separated list of absolute directories,
for example, <code>"/usr/lib/mypkg:/lib/foo"</code>.


</p><p>
If the same module is loaded several times, the same handle is returned.
If <code>lt_dlopen</code> fails for any reason, it returns <code>NULL</code>.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_dlhandle <b>lt_dlopenext</b> <i>(const char *<var>filename</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX164"></a>
The same as <code>lt_dlopen</code>, except that it tries to append
different file name extensions to the file name.
If the file with the file name <var>filename</var> cannot be found
libltdl tries to append the following extensions:



<ol>
<li>the libtool archive extension <samp>`.la'</samp>

</li><li>the extension used for native dynamic libraries on the host platform,

e.g., <samp>`.so'</samp>, <samp>`.sl'</samp>, etc.
</li></ol>

<p>
This lookup strategy was designed to allow programs that don't
have knowledge about native dynamic libraries naming conventions
to be able to <code>dlopen</code> such libraries as well as libtool modules
transparently.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlclose</b> <i>(lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX165"></a>
Decrement the reference count on the module <var>handle</var>.
If it drops to zero and no other module depends on this module,
then the module is unloaded.
Return 0 on success.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_ptr <b>lt_dlsym</b> <i>(lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>, const char *<var>name</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX166"></a>
Return the address in the module <var>handle</var>, where the symbol given
by the null-terminated string <var>name</var> is loaded.
If the symbol cannot be found, <code>NULL</code> is returned.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> const char * <b>lt_dlerror</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX167"></a>
Return a human readable string describing the most
recent error that occurred from any of libltdl's functions.
Return <code>NULL</code> if no errors have occurred since initialization
or since it was last called.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlpreload</b> <i>(const lt_dlsymlist *<var>preloaded</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX168"></a>
Register the list of preloaded modules <var>preloaded</var>.
If <var>preloaded</var> is <code>NULL</code>, then all previously registered
symbol lists, except the list set by <code>lt_dlpreload_default</code>,
are deleted. Return 0 on success.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlpreload_default</b> <i>(const lt_dlsymlist *<var>preloaded</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX169"></a>

</dt><dd><a name="IDX175"></a>
In some applications you may not want to load individual modules with
known names, but rather find all of the modules in a set of
directories and load them all during initialisation.  With this function
you can have libltdl scan the colon delimited directory list in
<var>search_path</var> for candidates, and pass them, along with <var>data</var>
to your own callback function, <var>func</var>.  If <var>seach_path</var> is
<samp>`NULL'</samp>, then search all of the standard locations that
<code>lt_dlopen</code> would examine.  This function will continue to make
calls to <var>func</var> for each file that it discovers in <var>search_path</var>
until one of these calls returns non-zero, or until the files are
exhausted.  <samp>`lt_dlforeachfile'</samp> returns value returned by the last
call made to <var>func</var>.


<p>
For example you could define <var>func</var> to build an ordered

which would cause your code to crash if removed.  Return 0 on success.


<p>
If you use <samp>`lt_dlopen (NULL)'</samp> to get a <var>handle</var> for the running

These variables are set to <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and <code>free</code> by
default, but you can set them to any other functions that provide equivalent
functionality.  If you change any of these function pointers, you will almost
certainly need to change all three to point into the same malloc library.
Strange things will happen if you allocate memory from one library, and then
pass it to an implementation of <code>free</code> that doesn't know what book
keeping the allocator used.

<h2><a name="SEC47" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC47">10.2 Creating modules that can be <code>dlopen</code>ed</a></h2>

<p>
Libtool modules are like normal libtool libraries with a few exceptions:


</p><p>
You have to link the module with libtool's <samp>`-module'</samp> switch,
and you should link any program that is intended to dlopen the module with
<samp>`-dlopen modulename.la'</samp> so that libtool can dlpreopen the module
on platforms which don't support dlopening.  If the module depends on any
other libraries, make sure you specify them either when you link the module
or when you link programs that dlopen it.
If you want to disable see section <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#SEC32">6. Library interface versions</a> for a specific module
you should link it with the <samp>`-avoid-version'</samp> switch.
Note that libtool modules don't need to have a "lib" prefix.
However, automake 1.4 or higher is required to build such modules.


</p><p>
Usually a set of modules provide the same interface, i.e, exports the same
symbols, so that a program can dlopen them without having to know more
about their internals.
In order to avoid symbol conflicts all exported symbols must be prefixed
with "modulename_LTX_" (<samp>`modulename'</samp> is the name of the module).
Internal symbols must be named in such a way that they won't conflict
with other modules, for example, by prefixing them with "_modulename_".
Although some platforms support having the same symbols defined more than
once it is generally not portable and it makes it impossible to dlpreopen
such modules.  libltdl will automatically cut the prefix off to get
the real name of the symbol.  Additionally, it supports modules which
don't use a prefix so that you can also dlopen non-libtool modules.


</p><p>
<tt>`foo1.c'</tt> gives an example of a portable libtool module.
Exported symbols are prefixed with "foo1_LTX_", internal symbols
with "_foo1_". Aliases are defined at the beginning so that the code
is more readable.



</p><pre>/* aliases for the exported symbols */
#define foo	foo1_LTX_foo
#define bar	foo1_LTX_bar

/* a global variable definition */
int bar = 1;

/* a private function */
int _foo1_helper() {
  return bar;
}

/* an exported function */
int foo() {
  return _foo1_helper();
}
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>`Makefile.am'</tt> contains the necessary rules to build the
module <tt>`foo1.la'</tt>:



</p><pre>...
lib_LTLIBRARIES = foo1.la

foo1_la_SOURCES = foo1.c
foo1_la_LDFLAGS = -module

<h2><a name="SEC48" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC48">10.3 Using libtldl in a multi threaded environment</a></h2>

<p>
Using the <code>lt_dlmutex_register()</code> function, and by providing some
appropriate callback function definitions, libltdl can be used in a
multi-threaded environment.


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> void <b>lt_dlmutex_lock</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX181"></a>
This is the type of a function pointer holding the address of a function
which will be called at the start of parts of the libltdl implementation
code which require a mutex lock.


<p>
Because libltdl is inherantly recursive, it is important that the
locking mechanism employed by these callback functions are reentrant, or
else strange problems will occur.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> void <b>lt_dlmutex_unlock</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX182"></a>
The type of a matching unlock function.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> void <b>lt_dlmutex_seterror</b> <i>(const char *<var>error</var>);</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX183"></a>
Many of the functions in the libltdl API have a special return
value to indicate to the client that an error has occured.  Normally (in
single threaded applications) a string describing that error can be
retrieved from internal storage with <code>lt_dlerror()</code>.


<p>
A function of this type must be registered with the library in order for
it to work in a multi-threaded context.  The function should store any
error message passed in thread local storage.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> const char * <b>lt_dlmutex_geterror</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX184"></a>
The type of a matching callback function to retrieve the last stored
error message from thread local storage.


<p>
When regeistered correctly this function will be used by
<code>lt_dlerror())</code> from all threads to retrieve error messages for the
client.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlmutex_register</b> <i>(lt_dlmutex_lock *<var>lock</var>, lt_dlmutex_unlock *<var>unlock</var>, lt_dlmutex_set_error *<var>seterror</var>, lt_dlmutex_geterror *<var>geterror</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX185"></a>
Use this function to register one of each of function ttypes described
above in preparation for multi-threaded use of libltdl.  All arguments
must be valid non-<code>NULL</code> function addresses, or else all
<code>NULL</code> to return to single threaded operation.
</dd></dl>




<h2><a name="SEC49" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC49">10.4 Data associated with loaded modules</a></h2>

<p>
Some of the internal information about each loaded module that is
maintained by libltdl is available to the user, in the form of this
structure:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> struct <b>lt_dlinfo</b> <i>{ char *<var>filename</var>; char *<var>name</var>; int <var>ref_count</var>; }</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX186"></a>
<code>lt_dlinfo</code> is used to store information about a module.
The <var>filename</var> attribute is a null-terminated character string of
the real module file name.  If the module is a libtool module then
<var>name</var> is its module name (e.g. <code>"libfoo"</code> for
<code>"dir/libfoo.la"</code>), otherwise it is set to <code>NULL</code>.  The
<var>ref_count</var> attribute is a reference counter that describes how
often the same module is currently loaded.
</dd></dl>


<p>
The following function will return a pointer to libltdl's internal copy
of this structure for the given <var>handle</var>:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> const lt_dlinfo * <b>lt_dlgetinfo</b> <i>(lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX187"></a>
Return a pointer to a struct that contains some information about
the module <var>handle</var>.  The contents of the struct must not be modified.
Return <code>NULL</code> on failure.
</dd></dl>


<p>
Furthermore, in order to save you from having to keep a list of the
handles of all the modules you have loaded, these functions allow you to
iterate over libltdl's list of loaded modules:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlforeach</b> <i>(int (*<var>func</var>) (lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>, lt_ptr <var>data</var>), lt_ptr <var>data</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX188"></a>
For each loaded module call the function <var>func</var>.  The argument
<var>handle</var> is the handle of one of the loaded modules, <var>data</var> is
the <var>data</var> argument passed to <code>lt_dlforeach</code>.
As soon as <var>func</var> returns a non-zero value for one of the handles,
<code>lt_dlforeach</code> will stop calling <var>func</var> and immediately return 1.
Otherwise 0 is returned.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_dlhandle <b>lt_dlhandle_next</b> <i>(lt_dlhandle place)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX189"></a>
Iterate over the loaded module handles, returning the first handle in the
list if <var>place</var> is <code>NULL</code>, and the next one on subsequent calls.
If <var>place</var> is the last element in the list of loaded modules, this
function returns <code>NULL</code>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
Of course, you would still need to maintain your own list of loaded
module handles to parallel the list maintained by libltdl if there are
any other data that you need to associate with each handle for the
purposes of your application.  However, if you use the following
API calls to associate your application data with individual module
handles as they are loaded there is actually no need to do that.  You
must first obtain a unique caller id from libltdl which you subsequently
use to retrieve the data you stored earlier.  This allows for different
libraries that each wish to store their own data against loaded modules
to do so without interfering with one another's data.


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_dlcaller_id</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX190"></a>
The opaque type used to hold individual data set keys.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_dlcaller_id <b>lt_dlcaller_register</b> <i>(void)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX191"></a>
Use this to obtain a unique key to store and retrieve individual sets of
per module data.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_ptr <b>lt_dlcaller_set_data</b> <i>(lt_dlcaller_id <var>key</var>, lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>, lt_ptr <var>data</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX192"></a>
Set <var>data</var> as the set of data uniquely associated with <var>key</var> and
<var>handle</var> for later retrieval.  This function returns the <var>data</var>
previously associated with <var>key</var> and <var>handle</var> if any.  A result of
0, may indicate that a diagnostic for the last error (if any) is available
from <code>lt_dlerror()</code>.


<p>
For example, to correctly remove some associated data:



</p><pre>    lt_ptr stale = lt_dlcaller_set_data (key, handle, 0);
    if (stale == NULL)
      {
        char *error_msg = lt_dlerror ();

        if (error_msg != NULL)
          {
            my_error_handler (error_msg);
            return STATUS_FAILED;
          }
      }
    else
      {
        free (stale);
      }
</pre>

</dd></dl>

<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> lt_ptr <b>lt_dlcaller_get_data</b> <i>(lt_dlcaller_id <var>key</var>, lt_dlhandle <var>handle</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX193"></a>
Return the address of the data associated with <var>key</var> and
<var>handle</var>, or else <code>NULL</code> if there is none.
</dd></dl>


<p>
The preceding functions can be combined with <code>lt_dlforeach</code> to
implement search and apply operations without the need for your
application to track the modules that have been loaded and unloaded:



</p><pre>int
my_dlcaller_callback (lt_dlhandle handle, lt_ptr key_ptr)
{
  struct my_module_data *my_data;

  my_data = lt_dlcaller_get_data (handle, (lt_dlcaller_id) *key_ptr);

  return process (my_data);
}

int
my_dlcaller_foreach (lt_dlcaller_id key)
{
  lt_dlforeach (my_dlcaller_callback, (lt_ptr) &amp;key);
}
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC50" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC50">10.5 How to create and register new module loaders</a></h2>

<p>
Sometimes libltdl's many ways of gaining access to modules are not
sufficient for the purposes of a project.  You can write your own
loader, and register it with libltdl so that <code>lt_dlopen</code> will be
able to use it.


</p><p>
Writing a loader involves writing at least three functions which can be
called  by <code>lt_dlopen</code>, <code>lt_dlsym</code> and <code>lt_dlclose</code>.
Optionally, you can provide a finalisation function to perform any
cleanup operations when <code>lt_dlexit</code> executes, and a symbol prefix
string which will be prepended to any symbols passed to <code>lt_dlsym</code>.
These functions must match the function pointer types below, after
which they can be allocated to an instance of <code>lt_user_dlloader</code>
and registered.


</p><p>
Registering the loader requires that you choose a name for it, so that it
can be recognised by <code>lt_dlloader_find</code> and removed with
<code>lt_dlloader_remove</code>.  The name you choose must be unique, and not
already in use by libltdl's builtin loaders:


</p><dl compact="compact">

<dt>"dlopen"
</dt><dd>
The system dynamic library loader, if one exists.
</dd><dt>"dld"
</dt><dd>
The GNU dld loader, if <tt>`libdld'</tt> was installed when libltdl was
built.
</dd><dt>"dlpreload"
</dt><dd>
The loader for <code>lt_dlopen</code>ing of preloaded static modules.
</dd></dl>

<p>
The prefix "dl" is reserved for loaders supplied with future versions of
libltdl, so you should not use that for your own loader names.


</p><p>
The following types are defined in <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt>:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_module</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX194"></a>
<code>lt_module</code> is a dlloader dependent module.
The dynamic module loader extensions communicate using these low
level types.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_dlloader</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX195"></a>
<code>lt_dlloader</code> is a handle for module loader types.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> <b>lt_user_data</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX196"></a>
<code>lt_user_data</code> is used for specifying loader instance data.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> struct <b>lt_user_dlloader</b> <i>{const char *<var>sym_prefix</var>; lt_module_open *<var>module_open</var>; lt_module_close *<var>module_close</var>; lt_find_sym *<var>find_sym</var>; lt_dlloader_exit *<var>dlloader_exit</var>; }</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX197"></a>
If you want to define a new way to open dynamic modules, and have the
<code>lt_dlopen</code> API use it, you need to instantiate one of these
structures and pass it to <code>lt_dlloader_add</code>.  You can pass whatever
you like in the <var>dlloader_data</var> field, and it will be passed back as
the value of the first parameter to each of the functions specified in
the function pointer fields.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> lt_module <b>lt_module_open</b> <i>(const char *<var>filename</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX198"></a>
The type of the loader function for an <code>lt_dlloader</code> module
loader.  The value set in the dlloader_data field of the <code>struct
lt_user_dlloader</code> structure will be passed into this function in the
<var>loader_data</var> parameter.  Implementation of such a function should
attempt to load the named module, and return an <code>lt_module</code>
suitable for passing in to the associated <code>lt_module_close</code> and
<code>lt_sym_find</code> function pointers.  If the function fails it should
return <code>NULL</code>, and set the error message with <code>lt_dlseterror</code>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> int <b>lt_module_close</b> <i>(lt_user_data <var>loader_data</var>, lt_module <var>module</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX199"></a>
The type of the unloader function for a user defined module loader.
Implementatation of such a function should attempt to release
any resources tied up by the <var>module</var> module, and then unload it
from memory.  If the function fails for some reason, set the error
message with <code>lt_dlseterror</code> and return non-zero.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> lt_ptr <b>lt_find_sym</b> <i>(lt_module <var>module</var>, const char *<var>symbol</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX200"></a>
The type of the symbol lookup function for a user defined module loader.
Implementation of such a function should return the address of the named
<var>symbol</var> in the module <var>module</var>, or else set the error message
with <code>lt_dlseterror</code> and return <code>NULL</code> if lookup fails.
</dd></dl>


<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Type:</u> int <b>lt_dlloader_exit</b> <i>(lt_user_data <var>loader_data</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX201"></a>
The type of the finalisation function for a user defined module loader.
Implementation of such a function should free any resources associated
with the loader, including any user specified data in the
<code>dlloader_data</code> field of the <code>lt_user_dlloader</code>.  If non-<code>NULL</code>,
the function will be called by <code>lt_dlexit</code>, and
<code>lt_dlloader_remove</code>.
</dd></dl>


<p>
For example:



</p><pre>int
register_myloader (void)
{
  lt_user_dlloader dlloader;

  /* User modules are responsible for their own initialisation. */
  if (myloader_init () != 0)
    return MYLOADER_INIT_ERROR;

  dlloader.sym_prefix    = NULL;
  dlloader.module_open   = myloader_open;
  dlloader.module_close  = myloader_close;
  dlloader.find_sym      = myloader_find_sym.
  dlloader.dlloader_exit = myloader_exit;
  dlloader.dlloader_data = (lt_user_data)myloader_function;

  /* Add my loader as the default module loader. */
  if (lt_dlloader_add (lt_dlloader_next (NULL), &amp;dlloader, "myloader") != 0)
    return ERROR;

  return OK;
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that if there is any initialisation required for the loader,
it must be performed manually before the loader is registered --
libltdl doesn't handle user loader initialisation.


</p><p>
Finalisation <em>is</em> handled by libltdl however, and it is important
to ensure the <code>dlloader_exit</code> callback releases any resources claimed
during the initialisation phase.


</p><p>
libltdl provides the following functions for writing your own module
loaders:


</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlloader_add</b> <i>(lt_dlloader *<var>place</var>, lt_user_dlloader *<var>dlloader</var>, const char *<var>loader_name</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX202"></a>
Add a new module loader to the list of all loaders, either as the
last loader (if <var>place</var> is <code>NULL</code>), else immediately before the
loader passed as <var>place</var>.  <var>loader_name</var> will be returned by
<code>lt_dlloader_name</code> if it is subsequently passed a newly
registered loader.  These <var>loader_name</var>s must be unique, or
<code>lt_dlloader_remove</code> and <code>lt_dlloader_find</code> cannot
work. Returns 0 for success.



<pre>{
  /* Make myloader be the last one. */
  if (lt_dlloader_add (NULL, myloader) != 0)
    perror (lt_dlerror ());
}
</pre>

</dd></dl>

<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> int <b>lt_dlloader_remove</b> <i>(const char *<var>loader_name</var>)</i>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX203"></a>
Remove the loader identified by the unique name, <var>loader_name</var>.
Before this can succeed, all modules opened by the named loader must
have been closed.  Returns 0 for success, otherwise an error message can
be obtained from <code>lt_dlerror</code>.



<pre>{
  /* Remove myloader. */
  if (lt_dlloader_remove ("myloader") != 0)
    perror (lt_dlerror ());
}
</pre>

</dd></dl>

<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><u>Function:</u> {lt_dlloader *}lt_dlloader_next <b>(lt_dlloader *<var>place</var>)</b>
</dt><dd><a name="IDX204"></a>
Iterate over the module loaders, returning the first loader if <var>place</var> is
<code>NULL</code>, and the next one on subsequent calls. The handle is for use with
<code>lt_dlloader_add</code>.



<pre>{
  /* Make myloader be the first one. */
  if (lt_dlloader_add (lt_dlloader_next (NULL), myloader) != 0)

<h2><a name="SEC52" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual.html#TOC52">10.6 How to distribute libltdl with your package</a></h2>

<p>
Even though libltdl is installed together with libtool, you may wish to
include libltdl in the distribution of your package, for the convenience
of users of your package that don't have libtool or libltdl installed.
In this case, you must decide whether to manually add the <code>ltdl</code>
objects to your package, or else which flavor of libltdl you want to use:
a convenience library or an installable libtool library.


</p><p>
The most simplistic way to add <code>libltdl</code> to your package is to copy
the source files, <tt>`ltdl.c'</tt> and <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt>, to a source directory
withing your package and to build and link them along with the rest of
your sources.  To help you do this, the m4 macros for autoconf are
available in <tt>`ltdl.m4'</tt>.  You must ensure that they are available in
<tt>`aclocal.m4'</tt> before you run autoconf -- by appending the contents
of <tt>`ltdl.m4'</tt> to <tt>`acinclude.m4'</tt>, if you are using automake, or
to <tt>`aclocal.m4'</tt> if you are not.  Having made the macros available,
you must add a call to the <samp>`AC_LIB_LTDL'</samp> macro to your package's
<tt>`configure.in'</tt> to perform the configure time checks required to
build <tt>`ltdl.o'</tt> correctly.  This method has problems if you then try
to link the package binaries with an installed libltdl, or a library
which depends on libltdl: you may have problems with duplicate symbol
definitions.


</p><p>
One advantage of the convenience library is that it is not installed, so
the fact that you use libltdl will not be apparent to the user, and it
will not overwrite a pre-installed version of libltdl a user might have.
On the other hand, if you want to upgrade libltdl for any reason
(e.g. a bugfix) you'll have to recompile your package instead of just
replacing an installed version of libltdl.
However, if your programs or libraries are linked with other libraries
that use such a pre-installed version of libltdl, you may get linker
errors or run-time crashes.  Another problem is that you cannot link the
convenience library into more than one libtool library, then link a
single program with these libraries, because you may get duplicate
symbols. In general you can safely use the convenience library in programs
which don't depend on other libraries that might use libltdl too.
In order to enable this flavor of libltdl, you should add the
line <samp>`AC_LIBLTDL_CONVENIENCE'</samp> to your <tt>`configure.in'</tt>,
<em>before</em> <samp>`AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'</samp>.


</p><p>
In order to select the installable version of libltdl, you should add a
call of the macro <samp>`AC_LIBLTDL_INSTALLABLE'</samp> to your
<tt>`configure.in'</tt> <em>before</em> <samp>`AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'</samp>.  This macro
will check whether libltdl is already installed and, if not, request the
libltdl embedded in your package to be built and installed.  Note,
however, that no version checking is performed.  The user may override
the test and determine that the libltdl embedded must be installed,
regardless of the existence of another version, using the configure
switch <samp>`--enable-ltdl-install'</samp>.


</p><p>
In order to embed libltdl into your package, just add <samp>`--ltdl'</samp> to
the <code>libtoolize</code> command line. It will copy the libltdl sources
to a subdirectory <samp>`libltdl'</samp> in your package.
Both macros accept an optional argument to specify the location
of the <samp>`libltdl'</samp> directory. By the default both macros assume that it
is <samp>`${top_srcdir}/libltdl'</samp>.


</p><p>
Whatever macro you use, it is up to you to ensure that your
<tt>`configure.in'</tt> will configure libltdl, using
<samp>`AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS'</samp>, and that your <tt>`Makefile'</tt>s will start
sub-makes within libltdl's directory, using automake's <var>SUBDIRS</var>,
for example.  Both macros define the shell variables <var>LIBLTDL</var>, to
the link flag that you should use to link with libltdl, and
<var>LTDLINCL</var>, to the preprocessor flag that you should use to compile
with programs that include <tt>`ltdl.h'</tt>.  It is up to you to use
<samp>`AC_SUBST'</samp> to ensure that this variable will be available in
<tt>`Makefile'</tt>s, or add them to variables that are <samp>`AC_SUBST'</samp>ed by
default, such as <var>LIBS</var> and <var>CPPFLAGS</var>.


</p><p>
If you're using the convenience libltdl, <var>LIBLTDL</var> will be the
pathname for the convenience version of libltdl and <var>LTDLINCL</var> will be
<samp>`-I'</samp> followed by the directory that contains libltdl, both starting
with <samp>`${top_builddir}/'</samp> or <samp>`${top_srcdir}/'</samp>, respectively.
